16336672|t|Fine needle aspiration cytology of primary thyroid lymphoma: a report of ten cases
16336672|a|

16336672|t|Primary lymphoma is an uncommon malignancy of the thyroid, comprising of 0.6 to 5 per cent of thyroid cancers in most series. Primary thyroid lymphomas (PTL) occur most commonly in elderly women and are commonly of B- cell origin. These frequently present in clinical stage IE and IIE. We report here ten cases of PTL diagnosed over a period of about 7 years in our institute. Out of these ten cases, nine were diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and one case was misdiagnosed as lymphocytic thyroiditis. This case was diagnosed as Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma on surgical specimen. Five patients are disease free and doing well, while two died of disease and the other two were lost to follow-up. One patient is currently on chemotherapy. The salient clinical, biochemical, radiological features, FNA findings along with diagnostic difficulties are discussed.

16336672|t|Introduction
16336672|a|

16336672|t|Primary thyroid lymphoma is a rare disease that continues to produce diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Most thyroid lymphomas are of B-cell origin [1]. There appear to be two distinct clinical and prognostic groups of these rare tumors. The more common subtype, comprising of up to 70% of cases, is a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [1]. This subtype appears to have the most aggressive clinical course with almost 60% of these tumors diagnosed with disseminated disease. The other subtype is mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas comprising of approximately 6% to 27% of thyroid lymphomas [1]. These have a relatively indolent course. These occur more commonly in females with female to male ratio of 2–4:1. The majority of these patients have underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which increases the risk for thyroid lymphoma by 50 times [2]. The importance of recognizing primary thyroid lymphoma lies in the fact that this disease is quite curable without the need for extensive surgery if recognized early and treated appropriately. In this report, we discuss FNA findings of ten such patients.

16336672|t|Materials and methods
16336672|a|

16336672|t|Ten cases of primary thyroid non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PTL) were retrieved from files of department of Cytopathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India over a seven year period (Jan 1998- Oct 2004), during this period about 4500 patients were aspirated for thyroid enlargement. Clinical information including age, sex, presenting symptoms, treatment and subsequent course were recorded. FNAC was performed with 23 G needle and on an average 2–3 passes were taken to obtain adequate material for diagnosis. Histopathology of the surgically resected specimens was available in three cases. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), cytokeratin, CD 20 and CD3 in six cases.

16336672|t|Of the 10 cases, 5 were female and 5 were males with female to male ratio of 1: 1. The age ranged from 10–61 years with a mean age of 39.6 years. Two patients were less than 15 years of age. Duration of follow-up ranged from 1 month to 4.3 years. A summary of clinical information and cytological findings is shown in Table 1. All patients presented with thyroid enlargement of variable duration (20 days to 2 years). Seven patients presented with a diffuse goiter, two patients had a multinodular goiter and only one patient presented as a solitary thyroid nodule. Other signs and symptoms included stridor, hoarseness, dyspnoea, dysphagia and sense of heaviness in the neck. Four patients had associated cervical lymphadenopathy and three of them had lymphomatous involvement while one had reactive hyperplasia.

16336672|t|Imaging modalities and bone marrow examination did not reveal other areas of involvement. CT scan done in these cases revealed a lesion primarily involving the thyroid gland (Figure 1). Hematological parameters, serum biochemistry and thyroid function tests were normal at presentation except in three patients, who were hypothyroid. Thyroid microsomal antibody (TMA) titer was significantly increased (1:80) in six patients.

16336672|t|Cytologically in nine cases, a diagnosis of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was offered on FNAC. These included six cases of high grade NHL and three cases of intermediate grade NHL. The smears in high grade NHL cases were cellular and comprised of monomorphic population of large atypical lymphoid cells. These cells were 2–3 times the size of a mature lymphocyte with opened up chromatin and conspicuous 1–2 nucleoli (Figure 2). In the background many lymphoglandular bodies were seen. One of these six cases had subsequent histological confirmation.

16336672|t|In three cases, FNAC smears showed a dual population of lymphoid cells comprising of an admixture of mature lymphocytes and larger lymphoid cells. These large lymphoid cells were 2–3 times the size of a mature lymphocyte and had opened up chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli (Figure 3). Many monocytoid cells were also seen. A diagnosis of florid lymphocytic thyroiditis was considered less likely, because, in thyroiditis, a reactive population of lymphoid cells of variable sizes admixed with plasma cells and tingible body macrophages is usually present. Hence, in these three cases, combining the clinical presentation and cytological findings, a diagnosis of NHL – intermediate grade was suggested.

16336672|t|In one case, the diagnosis of lymphoma was missed on FNA. The patient presented with a diffuse rather than a nodular swelling and cytology revealed a polymorphic infiltrate consistent with a reactive hyperplasia which was seen to infiltrate the follicular epithelial cell clusters. Hence a diagnosis of lymphocytic thyroiditis was offered. A subtotal thyroidectomy was performed because of associated pressure symptoms. Histopathology revealed a Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma morphologically and immunohistochemically consistent with a marginal zone B cell lymphoma.

Bone marrow examination, whole body 67Gallium scan, CECT abdomen and chest and CSF for malignant cytology was done in all patients before labeling a case as primary thyroid lymphoma. In the present series, 7 cases were of stage I (E) and three cases were of stage II (E). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were done in six out of ten patients and the mean LDH level was 628 U/L.

16336672|t|Discussion
16336672|a|

16336672|t|Primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) is defined as a lymphomatous process involving the thyroid gland without contiguous spread or distant metastases from other areas of involvement at diagnosis [3]. PTL constitutes 5% of all thyroid malignancies and occurs in less than 1% of all non- Hodgkin's lymphomas [3]. The majority of patients are middle to old aged women [4]. Studies have shown that PTL typically arises in the setting of autoimmune thyroiditis and it takes, on an average, 20 to 30 years to develop after the onset of lymphocytic thyroiditis [5]. A short history of a rapidly enlarging neck mass often associated with dyspnoea, difficulty in swallowing, or voice change is the hallmark presentation of thyroid lymphoma [6]. Therefore, clinically this may be confused with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Hoarseness, respiratory distress, cough and dysphagia were the usual presenting manifestations in our patients.
16336672|a|

16336672|t|Hypothyroidism at the time of diagnosis is documented in 30–40% of patients due to replacement of thyroid parenchyma by the lymphomatous process or due to underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyrotoxicosis is exceedingly rare [7]. Seven of our patients at presentation were euthyroid and three were hypothyroid. Circulating antibodies to thyroid peroxidase are positive in 60–80% of patients suggesting underlying lymphocytic thyroiditis as a predisposing factor. In the present series, six patients had significantly elevated thyroid microsomal antibody titer.
16336672|a|

16336672|t|Fine needle aspiration has become the procedure of choice for the initial pathological diagnosis of thyroid nodule. However, studies have also shown inconsistent results in the diagnosis of lymphoma of the thyroid. In one series, a correct diagnosis with FNAC was made in 70–80% of patients with thyroid lymphoma [8], but in others, FNA was suggestive but not diagnostic in only 50–60% of patients [9-12]. In the present study, nine out of ten cases (90%) of the cases of PTL were correctly diagnosed by FNA. A primary thyroid non-Hodgkin lymphoma is usually of large cell type [13] and a diagnosis of large cell lymphoma is easy on FNA and features like lack of cellular cohesion and presence of lymphoglandular bodies in the background are features strongly against a diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma [14]. ICC confirms the lymphoid origin of the cells and their B or T- lineage. By contrast, cytological diagnosis of MALT- lymphomas is difficult, because of heterogeneous appearance of the neoplastic infiltrate [14]. The principal problem with a cytological diagnosis of low- grade lymphoma of the thyroid is its differentiation from HT. The distinguishing features may be the abundance of lymphoid tissue and a high proportion of intermediate centrocyte- like cells in low- grade NHL as compared to HT. False negative results may be due to sampling error also as low- grade B- cell MALT lymphoma originates from HT and the two usually coexist [14]. Due attention to dual population of lymphoid cells, presence of monocytoid cells in FNA smears and extensive follicular epithelial destruction and the clinical setting enabled us to diagnose three cases of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma of intermediate grade. However, we missed the diagnosis of NHL on FNAC in one case reported as lymphocytic thyroiditis, which on subsequent subtotal thyroidectomy, was reported as non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. FNAC cytomorphology in conjunction with flow cytometric (FC) immunophenotyping has become a reliable and accurate method for the diagnosis and classification of many lymphoproliferative disorders. CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio comparisons are made with cytomorphological diagnoses of reactive, atypical, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma cases [15,16].
16336672|a|

16336672|t|PTL frequently present in clinical stage IE and IIE. Treatment is similar to other nodal lymphoma. For patients with intermediate or high-grade lymphoma, the best results are obtained from cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincrstine and prednisolone (CHOP) based chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is used most commonly after 3–6 courses of chemotherapy in form of modified mantle irradiation including thyroid, bilateral neck, supraclavicular area and mediastinum [17]. Our patients received CHOP based chemotherapy, two of our patients had relapsed with bone marrow involvement and local nodal recurrence. One died of lymphomatous process and other was controlled with radiotherapy. The poor prognostic factors include age more than 60 years, performance status grater than 1, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and β2 microglobulin, extranodal sites more than 1 and Ann -Arbor staged III-IV [18,19].

16336672|t|In summary, we report a retrospective study of ten cases of primary thyroid lymphomas. The diagnosis was established by fine needle aspiration in nine cases and one case was misdiagnosed as lymphocytic thyroiditis, which was diagnosed on surgical specimen. The cytological diagnosis of high grade lymphoma is easy and ICC can confirm suspicious cases. The diagnosis of low grade lymphoma is more difficult but clinical and radiological suspicion and cytomorphological features can help reaching the correct diagnosis in such cases.

17697375|a|

17697375|t|Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a method for rapid and reliable quantification of mRNA transcription. Internal standards such as reference genes are used to normalise mRNA levels between different samples for an exact comparison of mRNA transcription level. Selection of high quality reference genes is of crucial importance for the interpretation of data generated by real-time qPCR.

17697375|t|Results
17697375|a|

17697375|t|In this study nine commonly used reference genes were investigated in 17 different pig tissues using real-time qPCR with SYBR green. The genes included beta-actin (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), TATA box binding protein (TPB)and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ). The stability of these reference genes in different pig tissues was investigated using the geNorm application. The range of expression stability in the genes analysed was (from the most stable to the least stable): ACTB/RPL4, TBP, HPRT, HMBS, YWHAZ, SDHA, B2M and GAPDH.

17697375|t|Conclusion
17697375|a|

17697375|t|Expression stability varies greatly between genes. ACTB, RPL4, TPB and HPRT1 were found to have the highest stability across tissues. Based on both expression stability and expression level, our data suggest that ACTB and RPL4 are good reference genes for high abundant transcripts while TPB and HPRT1 are good reference genes for low abundant transcripts in expression studies across different pig tissues.

17697375|t|Background
17697375|a|

17697375|t|Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is an efficient method for quantification of mRNA transcription levels due to its high sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range; in addition, real-time qPCR is fast, easy to use and provides simultaneous measurement of gene expression in many different samples for a limited number of genes. One of the critical steps in comparing transcription profiles is accurate normalisation, therefore, a number of variables should be controlled such as amount of starting material, enzymatic efficiencies, differences in transcriptional activity and presence of inhibitors in different sample materials. One way to standardize samples is to quantify the starting material i.e. number of cells or quantity of RNA. However, this does not take the RNA quality and enzymatic efficiencies into account. To control these variables, which are not a result of the experimental design, normalisation using reference genes are routinely used e.g. [1-3]. The accurate quantification of reference genes allows normalisation of differences in amount of the amplified cDNA in individual samples. The normalisation adjusts for differences in amount and quality of starting material and differences in RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis, since the reference gene is exposed to the same preparation steps as the gene of interest. Recently a set of reference genes (ACTB, TBP and topoisomerase (DNA) II beta (TOP2B)) have proven suitable for normalisation of qPCR data of backfat and longissimus dorsi muscle in the pig [4].
17697375|a|

17697375|t|In the present study the expression stability and expression level of nine potential reference genes have been compared in 17 different pig tissues. This has enabled us to assess the suitability of the genes for normalisation of mRNA across several tissues leading to the identification of the best reference genes for studies of high and low abundance transcripts, respectively. The suitable reference genes from this study can be used for normalisation of qPCR data in several tissues. Thus, the study gives useful information of importance for a broad range of different functional studies.

Genes with different functions were chosen in order to avoid genes belonging to the same biological pathways that may be co-regulated.

17697375|t|Standard curves were generated using relative concentration vs. the threshold cycle (Ct). The linear correlation coefficient (R2) of all the nine genes ranged from 0.998 to 1.000. Based on the slopes of the standard curves, the amplification efficiencies of the standards ranged from 93%~103%, (derived from the formula E = 10 1/-slope -1). This calculation method results in efficiencies higher than 100% which is an overestimate of the "real efficiency" [9]. The not normalised Ct values of all the nine genes in all the samples were within 13.5 to 30.5 cycles, covered by the range of the standard curves.

17697375|t|The range of expression stability calculated by geNorm [6] in the genes analysed was (from the most stable to the least stable): ACTB/RPL4, TBP, HPRT1, HMBS, YWHAZ, SDHA, B2M and GAPDH (Figure 1). The M values for ACTB, RPL4, TBP, HPRT1, HMBS, YWHAZ and SDHA were lower than 1.5, and therefore it was concluded that these genes have comparable stability in different pig tissues. For calculation of normalization factor (NF) geNorm suggested the five most stable reference genes. The NF was calculated based on the geometric mean of the Ct values. Normalised Ct values are shown in Table 2. After normalization against the NF, the ranking of the relative expression levels was (from high to low): B2M, RPL4, ACTB, GAPDH, YWHAZ, SDHA, HPRT1, TBP and HMBS (Figure 2). Furthermore, HMBS, and GAPDH showed tissue-specific regulation, i.e. HMBS is clearly up-regulated in bone marrow and GAPDH is clearly up-regulated in muscle tissue.

17697375|t|Discussion
17697375|a|

17697375|t|For an exact comparison of mRNA transcription in different samples or tissues it is crucial to choose the appropriate reference gene. The optimal reference gene should be constantly transcribed in all types of cells at any time in cell cycle and differentiation. Moreover the transcription of such a gene should not be regulated by internal or external influences, at least not more than the general variation in RNA synthesis. The reference gene used for normalisation of gene expression in real-time qPCR studies should also pass through the same steps of analysis as the gene to be quantified. However, such a perfect reference gene does probably not exist. The stability in expression of often used reference genes such as GAPDH and ACTB has been shown to vary considerably and are consequently unsuitable as reference genes for normalisation of gene expression analysis in some cases [5,10-12]. Also the low expressed reference gene TBP is highly regulated when comparing normal and tumour tissues [13].
17697375|a|

17697375|t|Numerous studies have been carried out in order to evaluate reference genes in specific tissues in several species. The majority of these studies are directed towards specific tissues [1,3,7,14]. They clearly demonstrate that it is very difficult to find a 'universal' reference gene having stable expression in all cell types and tissues, and in particular to find reference genes that remain stable between samples taken at different time points under different experimental conditions. The first priority, however, is to identify genes with stable expression preferably across cell types since many real-time qPCR studies are performed on cDNA isolated from tissues with a mixed cell population.
17697375|a|

17697375|t|There have been limited experiments of reference gene selection for use in other livestock and production animal species. Bogaert et al. [15] proposed ubiquitin (UBB), ACTB and B2M as reference genes for normalisation of qPCR data for normal equine skin. In cattle studies, De Ketelaere et al. [16] selected SDHA, YWHAZ, and 18S rRNA as being the most stable genes for accurate normalisation of qPCR of bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes and Goossens et al. [2] found YWHAZ, GAPDH and SDHA to be the most stable reference genes across different preimplantation embryonic stages. Common for the bovine studies are the target of the studies, which are single cell populations. Garcia-Crespo et al. [17] compared expression of six potential reference genes in sheep tissues and found GAPDH with the lowest variation among the panel of six tissues, whereas ACTB and YWHAZ showed the worst score in variability. This is not in agreement with our findings but can be a result of the tissue composition. At present three studies have examined reference genes in pig i.e. Foss et al. [18] describes the use of GAPDH, ACTB and HPRT in immune cells and tissues using northern blot and PCR. In this study GAPDH was shown to be more stable than ACTB. Erkens et al [4] validated mRNA expression stability of 10 reference genes in porcine backfat and longissimus dorsi muscle. The most stable reference genes suitable for normalisation of qPCR data of backfat and longissimus dorsi muscle in the pig was ACTB, TBP and TOP2B. Kuijk et al. [19] investigated transcription levels of seven frequently used reference genes (inclusive B2M, ACTB, GAPDH) at different stages of early porcine embryonic development. Our study is the first detailed study of the stability and level of pig reference genes across a large number of tissues. Our findings confirm studies demonstrating tissue specific regulation of some of the commonly used housekeeping genes. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for choice of reference genes in studies where high and low abundant transcripts are under investigation. In agreement with the findings of Erkens et al. [4] both TBP and ACTB are suitable reference genes. However, our data show that ACTB is most relevant for high abundant transcripts, while TPB is most relevant for low abundant transcripts. It is clear from both Erkens et al. [4] and our study that GAPDH is quite unstable and not suitable as a reference gene.

17697375|t|Conclusion
17697375|a|

17697375|t|Our study demonstrates that expression stability varies greatly between genes. Seven of the nine genes investigated (i.e. ACTB, RPL4, TBP, HPRT1, HMBS, YWHAZ, SDHA) were found to have a high stability across tissues. Two of the genes investigated were shown to have tissue-specific regulation, i.e. HMBS is clearly up-regulated in bone marrow and GAPDH is clearly up-regulated in muscle. Based on both expression stability and expression level, our data suggest that ACTB and RPL4 are good reference genes for high abundant transcripts while TPB and HPRT1 are good reference genes for low abundant transcripts in expression studies across different pig tissues.

17697375|t|Candidate reference genes and primer design
17697375|a|

17697375|t|Nine housekeeping genes were selected from commonly used reference genes [5-7]. The porcine sequences of the genes were obtained by fasta search with the human cDNA sequence for each gene against a porcine EST database[8]. The consensus sequences were used for comparison with genomic porcine sequences, if available, to reveal the exon-intron structure. When no genomic porcine sequence was available the gene structure was obtained by comparison of the pig sequence with human and mouse genomic sequence assuming that the exon-exon boundaries are conserved between human, mouse and pig.
17697375|a|

17697375|t|All the primers were designed by Primer 3 software [20]. For information on primer sequences see Table 3. Primers spanning at least one intron were chosen to minimize inaccuracies due to genomic DNA contamination. If the genes had known pseudogenes, primers were chosen according to the alignment results between the genes and the pseudogenes, so the primers were unique to the genes and different from the pseudogenes. The secondary structure of the amplicons was analyzed by Mfold using the criteria -3<dG<0 [21] to optimize the PCR efficiency. Primers and amplicons were in silico verified with BLASTN for specificity and the size of the PCR products was confirmed with gel electrophoresis.

17697375|t|Seventeen different porcine tissues were collected from three young female siblings. Total RNA was extracted using different protocols depending of the tissue: TRIreagent® (Molecular Research Centre, inc.) for liver, kidney, thymus, RNeasy lipid kit (Qiagen) for adipose (subcutaneous), cortex cerebri, cerebellum, hippocampus, lymph nodules (jejunal), RNeasy Fibrous Kit (Qiagen) for muscle (longissimus dorsi), heart (muscle), skin (dermis and epidermis) and RNeasy kit (Qiagen) for pancreas, bone marrow, bladder, lung, stomach (mucosal membranes), small intestine (mucosal membranes) according to each manufacturer protocol. Contaminating DNA was degraded by treating each sample with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) according to the instructions manual, followed by a spin-column purification (Qiagen RNeasy). The total RNA was quantified by optical density and the quality was evaluated by gel electrophoresis. Intact rRNA subunit of 28S and 18S were observed on the gel indicating minimal degradation of the RNA.

17697375|t|For each transcript a standard curve was constructed using the purified PCR product generated for each specific primer pair. Single reactions were prepared for each cDNA along with each serial of dilution using the Brilliant® SYBR® Green Master Mix (Stratagene). Each PCR reaction also included a reverse transcription negative control (without reverse transcriptase) to confirm the absence of genomic DNA, a non template negative control to check for primer-dimer and a porcine genomic DNA control to verify no specific amplification with the primers. Each reaction consisted of 20 μl containing 2 μl of cDNA and 5 pmol of each primer. The real time qPCR was run on MX3000p (Stratagene). The cycling conditions were 1 cycle of denaturation at 95°C/10 min, followed by 40 three-segment cycles of amplification (95°C/30 sec, 58°C–63°C (gene depending, see table 2)/1 min, 72°C/30 sec) where the fluorescence was automatically measured during PCR and one three-segment cycle of product melting (95°C/1 min, 55°C/30 sec, 95°C/30 sec). The baseline adjustment method of the Mx3000 (Stratagene) software was used to determine the Ct in each reaction. A melting curve was constructed for each primer pair to verify the presence of one gene-specific peak and the absence of primer dimmer. All samples were amplified in duplicates and the mean was used for further analysis.

17697375|t|The gene expression levels were measured by real-time qPCR, and the expression stabilities were evaluated by the M value of geNorm [6]. The M value for each reference gene is the average pairwise variation for that gene with all the other tested control genes. Stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M value allows ranking of the tested genes according to their expression stability.

18350148|t|High Genetic Stability of Dengue Virus Propagated in MRC-5 Cells as Compared to the Virus Propagated in Vero Cells
18350148|a|

18350148|t|This work investigated the replication kinetics of the four dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1 to DEN-4), including dengue virus type 4 (DEN-4) recovered from an infectious cDNA clone, in Vero cells and in MRC-5 cells grown on Cytodex 1 microcarriers. DEN-1 strain Hawaii, DEN-2 strain NGC, DEN-3 strain H-87, and DEN-4 strain H-241 , and DEN-4 strain 814669 derived from cloned DNA, were used to infect Vero cells and MRC-5 cells grown in serum-free or serum-containing microcarrier cultures. Serum-free and serum-containing cultures were found to yield comparable titers of these viruses. The cloned DNA-derived DEN-4 started genetically more homogeneous was used to investigate the genetic stability of the virus propagated in Vero cells and MRC-5 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the DEN-4 propagated in MRC-5 cells maintained a high genetic stability, compared to the virus propagated in Vero cells. Amino acid substitutions of Gly104Cys and Phe108Ile were detected at 70%, 60%, respectively, in the envelope (E) protein of DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells, whereas a single mutation of Glu345Lys was detected at 50% in E of the virus propagated in MRC-5 cells. Sequencing of multiple clones of three separate DNA fragments spanning 40% of the genome also indicated that DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells contained a higher number of mutations than the virus growing in MRC-5 cells. Although Vero cells yielded a peak virus titer approximately 1 to 17 folds higher than MRC-5 cells, cloned DEN-4 from MRC-5 cells maintained a greater stability than the virus from Vero cells. Serum-free microcarrier cultures of MRC-5 cells offer a potentially valuable system for the large-scale production of live-attenuated DEN vaccines.

18350148|t|Introduction
18350148|a|

18350148|t|The four dengue serotype viruses (DEN-1 to DEN-4) (genus flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) are single stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The RNA genome contain sequences coding for three structural protein genes (core C, precursor membrane prM, and envelope E), seven non-structural protein genes (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5), and the flanking non-translating regions. DEN infection in humans causes a spectrum of illnesses, ranging from dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) . Approximately 50–100 million infections, including 250,000 cases of DHF with fatality rates varying from <1% to 5%, occur every year mostly in tropical and subtropical areas . Dengue is endemic in South-east Asia, where the severe form of DHF/DSS frequently associated with secondary DEN infections is the major cause of hospitalization of young children . A safe and effective dengue vaccine is still not available for prevention of DEN infection.
18350148|a|

18350148|t|The current DEN immunization strategy favors the use of live-attenuated vaccines which offer the advantage of a single dose, delivering a complete set of protective antigens and achieving a long-lasting immunity . Further, the use of a tetravalent DEN vaccine against each of the four serotypes would have the possibility to minimize the risk of severe dengue . Wild type DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4 strains have been attenuated by serial passage in primary dog kidney cells (or monkey kidney cells) – and final vaccines were produced in fetal rhesus lung cells or Vero cells –. Extensive clinical trials have demonstrated that each monovalent DEN vaccine appeared to be immunogenic and safe –. However, data obtained from clinical trials with a tetravalent vaccine formulation have not shown the predicted response, as immune imbalance or reactogenicity occurred for certain DEN serotypes , . Several other vaccine researchers also have applied the cDNA cloning added by chimeric virus technology and strategic modifications to generate viruses with the growth restriction phenotype in the genetic background of attenuated virus (for example, using DEN-4 with a deletion in 3′ NTR, attenuated 17D yellow fever vaccine or DEN-2 strain PDK-53) –. All of these cDNA-derived candidate DEN vaccines have been produced in Vero cells, recently certified for vaccine production. Although clinical trails with a few of these monotypic chimeric vaccines appeared to show desirable immunogenicity and reactogenicity, data from studies with such vaccines of other serotypes or a tetravalent vaccine formulation are still not available. Potential replication interference among the four serotype vaccine components that results in immune imbalance remains a concern.
18350148|a|

18350148|t|Replication interference could result from loss or increase of infectivity due to genetic instability and accumulation of mutations in certain vaccine components. Passages of DEN viruses or their derived chimeras in Vero cells ,  have been shown to generate mutations specific for host cell adaptation, virus attenuation, or other properties yet to be characterized. Recently, spot-check sequencing in the manufacturing of chimeric DEN-2 PDK-53 vaccine components has detected loss of attenuating mutation markers in a number of seed stocks during first several passages in Vero cells and these vaccine seeds were not appropriate for use . It is also possible that passage of virus in certain cells produces host-cell specific mutations which could contribute to host cells' innate immunity response in the vaccinees. The use of appropriate cell substrates and methods for culturing these cells for production of vaccines represents a critical factor affecting the maximum viral yield, genetic stability, immunogenicity, and ultimately vaccine safety and economic feasibility.
18350148|a|

18350148|t|Recently, a serum-free medium has been developed to support the growth of Vero cells on solid microcarriers and produce a high final yield for reovirus , Japanese encephalitis virus , and enterovirus type 71 , . Although an attempt has not been made for producing DEN vaccines, human diploid MRC-5 cells have been already used for the production of several live-virus vaccines such as oral polio, rubella, small pox, and varicella zoster . This study investigated Vero cells and MRC-5 cells for the production of the four wild type DEN serotypes, including DEN-4 derived from an infectious DNA clone. We focused on the processes of cell culture using microcarrier systems which can be adapted for large-scale production and serum-free medium to avoid potential contamination from bovine serum. Currently, several panels of tetravalent DEN vaccine candidates have been derived from viruses of diverse genetic background responsible for growth restriction , . In order to simplify interpretation of results, cloned DNA derived wild type DEN-4 was used for comparison of progeny genetic stabilities from passages of the virus in Vero cells and in MRC-5 cells. This strategy using cloned DNA-derived wild type rather than attenuated DEN-4 has been previously used to investigate the genetic mutations of chimeric DEN-4 after Vero cell adaptation . Our present studies show that Vero cells yielded a peak virus titer approximately 1 to 17 folds higher than MRC-5 cells, and DEN-4 propagated in MRC-5 cells maintained a greater stability than the virus propagated in Vero cells. Serum-free microcarrier cultures of MRC-5 cells offer a potentially valuable system for the large-scale production of live-attenuated DEN vaccine.

18350148|t|Microcarrier cultures of Vero cells and MRC-5 cells grown in serum-free and serum-containing media
18350148|a|

18350148|t|Solid microcarriers (Cytodex 1) have been shown to support the growth of Vero cells in either serum-containing or serum-free medium –. To investigate whether microcarriers also support the growth of MRC-5 cells, MRC-5 cells were seeded at an initial density of 3×105 cell/ml in serum-containing medium or 6×105 cells/ml in serum-free medium on microcarriers. Vero cells were also seeded at same density in the respective medium as a control. Three days after incubation, both the Vero cells and MRC-5 cells adhered to the entire surface of the microcarrier beads, reaching confluency as seen microscopically (Fig. 1). The cell density was determined at 1.6×106 cells/ml in serum-free medium or 1.4×106 cells/ml in serum-containing medium for MRC-5 cells, compared to 1.7×106 cells/ml in serum-containing medium or 1.8×106 cells/ml in serum-free medium for Vero cells. Doubling the cell density in serum-free culture was needed to support the cell growth on microcarriers. Increased cell seed lot consumption in serum-free cultures is a continuing problem in vaccine manufacturing processes, particularly in large-scale microcarrier cultures. We are currently optimizing additional components in the M-VSFM medium to reduce the cell density for initial inoculation in serum-free microcarrier cultures (data not shown).

18350148|a|

18350148|t|Production of DEN-1 strain Hawaii, DEN-2 strain NGC, DEN-3 strain H-87 and DEN-4 strain H-241 in Vero cells and in MRC-5 cells grown in serum-containing and serum-free media was studied. Figs. S2, S3, S4 and S5 show the cell growth and virus replication curves at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in serum-free and serum-containing media. In each case the cell density decreased gradually during the 10-day period following virus infection, and no appreciable differences were observed between cells growing in serum-free medium and in serum-containing cultures. The virus yields from Vero cells was 1 to 17 folds higher than that from MRC-5 cells for each serotype virus (Table 1), whether in serum-containing or serum-free medium. Compared to DEN-2 NGC, DEN-3 H87 and DEN-4 H241 produced a 103- to 104-fold lower viral yield from Vero cells or a 102- to 103-fold lower yield from MRC-5 cells in serum-containing medium. The serotype difference was probably not responsible for the low viral yields, as the DEN-4 strain derived from cDNA replicated as efficiently as DEN-2. A plausible reason for the unexpected low yields is that these viruses have acquired mutations during passages in cultured cells or in animals. This probability was supported from the analysis of viral yields in similar infections with the wild type DEN-4 derived from a cDNA clone (see next section). Importantly, higher viral yields from Vero cells or MRC-5 cells were consistently observed at 0.3- to 2.6-fold higher for the four DEN serotypes in serum-free medium than in serum-containing media.

18350148|a|

18350148|t|DEN-4 strain 814669 recovered from cloned DNA was propagated in microcarrier cultures of both cell lines. Infection with the virus was carried out at the same multiplicity as described earlier. The density of Vero cells or MRC-5 cells decreased steadily during the subsequent 10-day period, indicating that both cells were readily infected (Fig. S5). The viral yields of cloned DNA derived DEN-4 in microcarrier cultures of both cells were comparable to that observed for DEN-2 NGC. There were appreciable differences in the viral yields between cell cultures in serum-containing or serum-free medium (Table 1). Vero cells produced a virus titer of cloned DEN-4 increased by 11 folds (serum-free medium) and 14 folds (serum-containing medium) as compared to MRC-5 cells.
18350148|a|

18350148|t|DEN-4 derived from cloned DNA was propagated in the microcarrier cultures of Vero cells or MRC-5 cells in serum-free or serum-containing medium for 4 days. The nucleotide sequence of progeny DEN-4 was determined from a single cDNA clone representing each of the four overlapping regions, designated as W01/W02R, W03/W04R, W05/W06R, W07/W08R, spanning the entire DEN genome. Each progeny DEN-4 sequence was compared with the parent DEN-4 DNA sequence (GenBank accession number: AF375822). The results in Table 2 revealed that there were 18 nucleotide mutations resulting in 13 amino acid changes in DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells using serum-containing medium, and 11 nucleotide mutations resulting in 6 amino acid changes in DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells grown in serum-free medium. In contrast, there was only one nucleotide mutation resulting in one amino acid change in each DEN-4 propagated in MRC-5 cells grown in serum-containing medium or in serum-free medium. None of the amino acid changes was identical between the DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells grown in serum–containing medium or in serum-free medium. Further, these amino acid changes in DEN-4 occurred in nearly all gene segments and the number of mutations, ie., a total of 6 each in NS3 and in NS4B-NS5, appeared to reflect the large size of the gene segments. This suggests that a host range selection of mutations was probably not involved. By comparison, there was only one amino acid change in the entire genome of DEN-4 from MRC-5 cells whether or not serum was present in the medium. This finding indicates that a greater genomic stability of cloned DNA-derived DEN-4 was observed when the virus was propagated in MRC-5 cells, compared to virus propagated in Vero cells.

18350148|t|Sequences of multiple clones of three genomic fragments
18350148|a|

18350148|t|Since the previous DEN-4 sequence determination was made from one DNA clone representing each of the four genome segments, to further investigate the genome stability of DEN-4 during passages in Vero cells and in MRC-5 cells, sequences of multiple clones were determined. The DNA-derived DEN-4 viruses were obtained in Vero cells or in MRC-5 cells at three consecutively passages after in vitro RNA transfection (as P1, P2, P3 samples). P1 and P2 viruses were harvested from cells grown in T flask cultures and the P3 passage virus was from a microcarrier culture. Multiple clone sequencings were conducted on the three genomic fragments (WE1/W02R, W28/W29R, W21/W23R) because most mutations identified earlier were localized in these fragments. These fragments are: (i) WE1/W02R, consisting of the full-length E gene and the NS1 gene portion encoding the first 152 amino acids; (ii) W28/W29R, consisting of part of NS3 gene encoding the amino acids 42–455; and (iii) W21/W23R, consisting of the entire NS4B gene and the NS5 gene portion encoding the first 180 amino acids. A total of 180 independent clones were obtained for sequence determination in this study.

18350148|t|No nucleotide mutation was found in the WE1/W02R (E-NS1) fragments of P1 and P2 passages from Vero or MRC-5 cells (Table 3). However, there were 7 nucleotide differences that resulted in 5 amino acid mutations in E protein at G104C, F108I, G427R, V439F, and V463L from Vero cells after three passages. Likewise, there were 3 nucleotide differences including 3 amino acid mutations in E protein at E345K, N362K, and G427R from MRC-5 cells (Table 3). The mutation frequencies of G104C and F108I in Vero cells and E345K in MRC-5 cells were 70%, 60%, and 50% respectively. In the W28/W29R (NS3) fragments, the P3 viruses from microcarrier cultures revealed 16 mutations resulting in 11 amino acid changes in Vero cells and 3 mutations resulting in 2 amino acid changes in MRC-5 cells. Each of these mutations in the NS3 protein occurred at a frequency of 10% except E341G at a frequency of 20% (Table 4). In the W21/W23R (NS4B-NS5) fragment, there were 11 mutations resulting in 10 amino acid changes in the P3 virus from Vero cells on microcarriers. The mutations were found at L112F and A240V in the NS4B protein at a frequency of 30%, while other mutations occurred at a frequency of 10%. Interestingly, there was only 1 nucleotide mutation resulting in 1 amino acid change in DEN-4 from MRC-5 cells grown on microcarriers at P3 (Table 5).

The values of mean diversity calculated for these three genomic fragments were 0.31 (WE1/W02R), 0.29 (W28/W29R), and 0.31 (W21/W23R) in Vero cells, as compared to 0.13 (WE1/W02R), 0.05 (W28/W29R), and 0 (W21/W23R) in MRC-5 cells. The values of mean diversity calculated from MRC-5 cells were at least 2 folds lowered than from Vero cells. Calculation of the p-distance based on pair wise comparisons of amino acid sequences between clones also showed the values of mean p-distance were 0.36 (range 0–0.70) in Vero cells compared to 0.19 (range 0–0.50) in MRC-5 cells in the WE1-W02R fragment; 0.56 (range 0–0.12) in Vero cells compared to 0.13 (range 0–0.50) in MRC-5 cells in the W28-W29R fragment; 0.50 (range 0–1.40) in Vero cells compared to 0 (range 0) in MRC-5 cells in the W21-W23R fragment. All of these data demonstrated that the cloned DEN4 propagated in MRC-5 cells were more stable than those propagated in Vero cells.

18350148|t|Discussion
18350148|a|

18350148|t|This work has investigated the replication kinetics of four-serotype and cloned DNA-derived DEN viruses in Vero and MRC-5 cells. Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells are polyploidy (recently certified as cell hosts for producing DEN vaccines) and MRC-5 (human fetal lung fibroblast cells) are diploid. Both cell lines have been already used to develop several human vaccines , and Vero cells are currently used for candidate DEN vaccine production. However, viral yield and genetic stability of DEN viruses have not been systematically compared between Vero and MRC-5 cell lines.
18350148|a|

18350148|t|High titers of DEN-1 (HAWAII) and DEN-2 (NGC) but relatively low titers of DEN-3 (H-87) and DEN-4 (H-241) were obtained in this study in either Vero cells or MRC-5 cells, although both cells were grown to a similar density on microcarrieres prior to virus infection. A possible explanation is that the DEN-4 (H-241) virus strain used was the non mouse-adapted strain rather than the prototype mouse-adapted strain since the non mouse-adapted strain was associated with two E protein mutations (Ile for Thr-155, Leu for Phe-401) . This study obtained high titers (1∼2×106 pfu/ml) of cloned DEN-4 (81466 strain) in both Vero cells and MRC-5 cells. The viral yield of cloned DEN-4 (81466 strain) produced in MRC-5 cells on microcarriers (at P3) was approximately 10 folds lower and had only one amino acid change compared to those in Vero cells with thirteen and six amino acid mutations in serum-free and serum-containing cultures, respectively (Table 2). Almost no P1 and P2 virus mutations in the Vero and MRC-5 cells grown in T flasks were found by sequencing of multiple clones (Tables 3∼ 5). The increased genetic mutations of cloned DEN4 observed in Vero cells were probably caused by passage number or high-density microcarrier culture rather than the increased virus yield.

18350148|t|Comparative mutation rate in this study was based only on the genomic sequences of the cloned DNA-derived DEN4 from passages 1 through 3, the latter representing microcarrier culture viruses. This study did not investigate the genomic characteristics of the non-cloned wild type viruses such as the DEN-1 (HAWAII), DEN-2 (NGC), DEN-3 (H-87), and DEN-4 (H-241) strains used for the virus yield studies in Figs S1, S2, S3 and S4. Thus, only the cloned DNA-derived DEN-4 virus started genetically more homogeneous was analyzed. The genomic changes in the cloned DEN-4 viruses in Table 2 indicate that the mutations occurred in C, E, NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 but not in the 5′-NTR or 3′-NTR regions. This result is partly agreed with other related reports of mutations in C, M, E, NS2A, NS4B and NS5 regions for the DEN-2/DEN-4 chimeric virus , and in 5′ NTR, C, E, NS1, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 regions for the chimeric DEN-4/Japanese encephalitis virus . Multiple cloning experiments showed that most mutations were at 10% frequency and occurred in the third passage (P3) using microcarrier cultures (Tables 3, 4, 5). The E-G104C, E-F108I in Vero cells and the E-E345K in MRC-5 cells had mutation rates exceeding 50% and the NS4B-L112F and NS4B-A240V in Vero cells had mutation rates of 30%. These results conflict with the high rate of NS3 gene mutation reported in a recent study of the full-genomic sequences of several DEN-3 clinical isolates . Reportedly, NS4B is a key determinant of Vero cell adaptation for the intertypic-DEN chimeric viruses , . Our experiments showed that the NS4B-L112F and NS4B-A240V mutations occur in Vero cells at a frequency of only 30% (Table 5), which partially correlates with other studies of infectious clone DEN viruses  and 5′-FU mutagenized DEN viruses . However, the present report found that the E-G104C, E-F108I mutations in Vero cells and the E-E345K mutation in MRC-5 cells occurred at a higher frequency than the NS4B-L112F and NS4B-A240V mutations in Vero cells.
18350148|a|

18350148|t|The DEN2-PDK-53-based chimeric viruses have recently been characterized by multiple plaque selection and spot/genomic sequencing . The current data based on the first three passages have already demonstrated a better genetic stability in MRC-5 cells than in Vero cells. Prompted by reports of success in manufacturing the DEN2-PDK-53-based tetravalent vaccine in certified Vero cells , the authors are currently investigating the genetic stability of attenuated chimeric cloned viruses of four serotypes to high passage levels. Passage numbers are limited to less than 10 since live-attenuated vaccines require limited passage levels from the seed virus to prevent unsafe virus reversion. After all, the data obtained in this study at the third passage of serum-free microcarrier cultures have already shown that the DEN virus propagated in MRC-5 cells is genetically more stable than in Vero cells. Therefore, despite the acceptance of Vero cells for many candidate DEN vaccine productions, the current findings indicate that MRC-5 cells grown on microcarriers may offer a more stable system for DEN virus production. This study is apparently the first to demonstrate that MRC-5 cells are a potentially better cell host for live-attenuated DEN vaccine production. These findings may be helpful in developing a biomanufacturing process for DEN vaccine production using high-density microcarrier cultures.

18350148|a|

18350148|t|DEN-1 virus (Hawaii), DEN-2 virus (NGC), DEN-3 virus (H-87) and DEN-4 virus (H-241) were provided by the Center of Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan. Stock viruses were prepared from supernatants of infected C6/36 cells grown in Hank's MEM medium (GIBCO) plus supplements 6 days post-infection at 28°C . The plasmid of DEN-4 strain 814669 contained the full-length genomic sequence . The plasmid was first linearized by cleavage with restriction enzyme Kpn I and then added to a transcription reaction mixture (Promega kit) containing m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (Merck) for cap addition at the RNA 5′-end. After incubation at 37°C for 1.5 hour, the RNA product was purified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Prior to RNA transfection, subconfluent Vero cells and MRC-5 cells in a 24-well plate were rinsed once with serum-free medium and then covered with 0.3 ml of DMEM medium per well. The transfection mixture was prepared by adding 4 µl of DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) to 1 ml of DMEM, then mixing with 10 µg of the RNA product. The transfection mixture was added directly to cell monolayers. After 18 hours incubation at 37°C, either DMEM+10% FBS or M-VSFM medium were added to the well. Eight days after transfection, culture supernatants were collected. All virus stocks were stored at −80°C freezer for further analysis.

18350148|t|Cytodex 1 microcarriers (Amersham Biosciences) were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the Cytodex 1 microcarriers were immersed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for at least three hours and autoclaved for 15 min before each experiment. The autoclaved microcarriers were washed twice with the culture medium. Bellco spinner flasks (100-ml) were used in the experiments for a working volume of 50 ml. The spinner flasks were stirred at 60 rpm and placed inside an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were detached from tissue culture flasks using trypsin-EDTA, and then transferred to a spinner flask containing 2g/l Cytodex 1 microcarriers. Starting cell densities were 3×105 cells/ml in serum-containing cultures and 6×105 cells/ml in serum-free cultures. The cell cultures were infected after 3 day inoculation and by replacing 70% of the medium with fresh medium containing the virus inoculum at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Inoculation continued without further replacement with fresh medium or addition of supplements.

18350148|a|

18350148|t|The number of cells attached to the microcarriers was determined by nuclei staining. Briefly, a 1-ml sample of the microcarrier culture was taken and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant. The pellets were treated with 1 ml 0.1 M citric acid [containing 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet] and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The released nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer. The virus titer was measured by 10-fold serial dilutions of the culture supernatant in duplicate infections of BHK-21 cell monolayers in a 6-well plate. After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, 4 ml of medium containing 10% FBS and 1.1% methylcellulose (4 ml/well) was added to each well. Virus plaques were stained with naphthol blue black dye six days after incubation. The infectivity titer in plaque forming units (pfu) per ml was determined.

18350148|t|Sequencing the entire genome of cloned DNA-derived DEN-4
18350148|a|

18350148|t|Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription using Superscript II RTase (Invitrogen). The double-stranded DNA was then generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Four overlapping fragments that span the entire DEN genome were produced using 4 sets of forward and reverse primers: (i) W01/W02R, (ii) W03/W04R, (iii) W05/W06R, and (iii) W07/W08R as listed in Table S1. The DNA products were purified by Gel/PCR DNA fragments extraction kit (Geneaid, Taiwan), cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega). The nucleotide sequences of each of the four fragments cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (from two upstream promoters SP6 and T7 at both ends of the vector) were determined by Mission Biotech Inc., Taipei, Taiwan. The cloned DNA segments that span the entire DEN genome were mapped using the software Lasergene version 6.00 (DNASTAR, Inc. USA) to determine the extent of overlapping sequences.

18350148|t|Sequencing multiple clones of three DEN-4 fragments
18350148|a|

18350148|t|Three DNA fragments were synthesized from DEN-4 RNA by RT-PCR using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase with their respective forward and reverse primer sets: (i) WE1/W02R, (ii) W28/W29R, and (iii) W21/W23R (see Table S1 for sequences and their genomic locations). Each of these DNA fragments was inserted into pGEM T-easy cloning vector to obtain 10 or more independent clones for sequence analysis. The sequences were aligned in the WE1/W02R region (1,653-bp), the W28/W29R region (1,260-bp), and the W21/W23R region (1,278-bp) using the program Lasergene version 6.00 to generate the consensus sequence for each of the three fragemnts. The mean diversity of amino acids was determined as the number of amino acid substitutions divided by the total number amino acids sequenced , , . Pair wise comparisons of amino acid sequences between clones were performed to determine the mean and range of pair wise distance matrix (p-distance) using the program MEGA version 3.1 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, Pennsylvania State University, PA). The p-distance is the proportion of amino acid mutations at which the two sequences to be compared are different.

19148276	40	67	Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids	Chemical	MESH:D005231

19148276|t|Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have a role in many physiological processes, including energy production, modulation of inflammation, and maintenance of cell membrane integrity. High plasma PUFA concentrations have been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality. To identify genetic contributors of plasma PUFA concentrations, we conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma levels of six omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in 1,075 participants in the InCHIANTI study on aging. The strongest evidence for association was observed in a region of chromosome 11 that encodes three fatty acid desaturases (FADS1, FADS2, FADS3). The SNP with the most significant association was rs174537 near FADS1 in the analysis of arachidonic acid (AA; p = 5.95×10−46). Minor allele homozygotes had lower AA compared to the major allele homozygotes and rs174537 accounted for 18.6% of the additive variance in AA concentrations. This SNP was also associated with levels of eicosadienoic acid (EDA; p = 6.78×10−9) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA; p = 1.07×10−14). Participants carrying the allele associated with higher AA, EDA, and EPA also had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels. Outside the FADS gene cluster, the strongest region of association mapped to chromosome 6 in the region encoding an elongase of very long fatty acids 2 (ELOVL2). In this region, association was observed with EPA (rs953413; p = 1.1×10−6). The effects of rs174537 were confirmed in an independent sample of 1,076 subjects participating in the GOLDN study. The ELOVL2 SNP was associated with docosapentanoic and DHA but not with EPA in GOLDN. These findings show that polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes in the metabolism of PUFA contribute to plasma concentrations of fatty acids.

19148276|a|

19148276|t|Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have a number of beneficial effects on human health. Plasma PUFA concentrations are determined by a combination of dietary intake and metabolic efficiency. To determine the genes involved in PUFA homeostasis, we scanned the genome for genetic variations associated with plasma PUFA concentrations. The fatty acid desaturase gene, studied in previous candidate gene association studies, was the strongest determinant of plasma PUFA. A second gene encoding a fatty acid elongase was associated with long chain PUFA. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the genetics of PUFA homeostasis. These genetic markers may be useful tools to examine the inter-relationship between diet, genetics, and disease.

19148276|t|Introduction
19148276|a|

19148276|t|Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) refer to the class of fatty acids with multiple desaturations in the aliphatic tail. Short chain PUFA (up to 16 carbons) are synthesized endogenously by fatty acid synthase. Long chain PUFA are fatty acids of 18 carbons or more in length with two or more double bonds. Depending on the position of the first double bond proximate to the methyl end, PUFA are classified as n-6 or n-3. Long chain PUFA are either directly absorbed from food or synthesized from the two essential fatty acids linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) through a series of desaturation and elongation processes [1]. The initial step in PUFA biosynthesis is the desaturation of ALA and LA by the enzyme d6-desaturase (FADS2; GeneID 9415) (Figure 1). PUFA modulate inflammatory response through a number of different mechanisms including modulation of cyclooxygenase and lipoxigenase activity [2]. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxigenase are essential for production of eicosanoids and resolvins [2]–[4]. Since n-3 and n-6 fatty acids compete for the same metabolic pathway and produce eicosanoids with differing effects, it has been theorized that the balance of the two classes of PUFA may be important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.

19148276|t|Epidemiological studies have shown that fatty acid consumption and plasma levels, in particular of the n-3 family, are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [5]–[7], diabetes [8]–[10], depression [11],[12], and dementia [13]. However, not all studies show significant associations and there has been inconsistencies in the direction of the associations especially for the n-6 acids [14],[15]. The different methods (dietary questionnaire or biomarkers) for accessing PUFA status may contribute to discrepant results [16]–[18]. The disadvantage of using dietary PUFA intake is the evidence of inaccuracies intrinsic in any reporting methods of dietary intake that plasma levels would circumvent. In addition, direct measures of PUFA reflect the cumulative effects of intake and endogenous metabolism. Dietary fatty acids can be converted into longer chain PUFA or stored for energy thus another reason for inconsistent results may be due the general lack of control for individual differences in metabolism once fatty acids are consumed.

19148276|t|Previous studies have examined the association of genetic variants, especially polymorphisms in the FADS genes, on fatty acid concentrations in plasma and erythrocyte membranes [19]–[21]. There are 3 FADS (FADS1 [GeneID 3992] ,FADS2, and FADS3 [GeneID 3992]) clustered on chromosome 11. Variants in FADS1 and FADS2 have been consistently shown to be associated with PUFA concentrations. It is unknown whether other loci also determine fatty acid concentrations. To address this question, we conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma fatty acid concentration in participants in the InCHIANTI study.

19148276|t|Linoleic acid (LA) constituted the highest proportion of total fatty acids followed by arachidonic acid (AA) (Table 1) The narrow heritability was highest for AA (37.7%) followed by LA (35.9%), eicosadienoic acid (EDA, 33.3%), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 28.1%), eicosapentanoic acid (EPA, 24.4%), and docosahexanoic acid (DHA,12.0%). For EDA, AA, and EPA, genome-wide significant signals fell in the FADS1/FADS2/FADS3 region on chromosome 11 (Figure 2, Figure 3, Table S1). Of these, the most significant SNP was rs174537 for AA (P = 5.95×10−46), where the variant explained 18.6% of the additive variance of AA concentrations. This SNP was significantly associated with EDA (P = 6.78×10−9), and EPA (P = 1.04×10−14). The association with LA (P = 5.58×10−7) and ALA (P = 2.76×10−5) did not reach genome-wide significance, and there was no association with DHA (P = 0.3188). Presence of the minor allele (T) was associated with lower concentrations of longer chain fatty acids (EDA, AA, EPA), but with higher concentrations of LA and ALA (Table 2). With the exception of DHA, the SNPs exhibiting the strongest evidence of association with the fatty acids examined in this study mapped to the FADS1, FADS2, and FADS3 cluster. The most significant SNP for DHA was on chromosome 12 within the SLC26A10 gene (GeneID 65012, rs2277324; PDHA = 2.65×10−9). In all cases, inclusion of the most significant SNP as a covariate in the model resulted in attenuation of the effect of the other SNPs in the region (Figure S1). Accordingly, associated SNPs in this region were in significant linkage disequilibrium with each other in the InCHIANTI sample (Figure S2).

19148276|t|To investigate whether this SNP has an effect on other cardiovascular disease risk factors, we examined the association of rs174537 with plasma lipid parameters. Significant association was observed with total cholesterol (P = 0.027) and LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.011), but not with either HDL-C (P = 0.775) or triglycerides (P = 0.862; Table 2).

19148276|t|To identify other putative chromosome regions associated with fatty acid concentrations beyond the FADS cluster, we examined the top 3 non-redundant (r2<0.2) SNPs from the analysis of each fatty acid and selected the SNPs that mapped to candidate gene regions (defined as 20kb upstream of intron 1, or downstream of last exon) for replication in an independent study (Table S1). These included rs16940765 (HRH4 [GeneID 59340], chr18, PEDA = 2.18×10−6), rs17718324 (SPARC [GeneID 6678], chr5, PAA = 7.64×10−7) and rs953413 (ELOVL2 [GeneID 54898], chr6, PAA = 1.1×10−6). In the InCHIANTI study, these four SNPs most strongly associated with a specific fatty acid, unlike FADS cluster that was associated with multiple fatty acids. We noted, however that rs16940765 (HRH4), rs953413 (ELOVL2) and rs2277324 (SLC26A10) showed significant association at the 0.05 level for AA (P = 0.003), DHA (0.004), and EPA (P = 0.004) respectively. In addition, there were four SNPs (rs953413, rs1570069, rs3798719, rs7744440) in the ELOVL2 gene were associated with EPA with p values ranging from 9.51×10−5 to 1.10×10−6 (Figure S3). In total, 5 SNPs (rs174537, rs2277324, rs16940765, rs17718324, rs953413) were selected for replication.

As with the InCHIANTI study, presence of the T allele was associated with higher ALA and LA concentration and lower AA, EPA, DPA and DHA concentrations. Consistent with the InCHIANTI study, this SNP was associated with total cholesterol and LDL-C but not triglycerides or HDL-C. We also observed strong associations of rs953413 with docosapentanoic acid (DPA; P = 0.002) and DHA (P<0.001). The presence of the minor allele (A) was associated with lower DHA and higher DPA and higher AA compared to the minor allele carriers (Table 2). The remaining 3 SNP (rs2277324, rs16940765, rs17718324) were not associated with fatty acid concentrations in the GOLDN study (data not shown).

19148276|t|Discussion
19148276|a|

19148276|t|The genome-wide association approach enables comprehensive examination of the genome to identify novel loci contributing to PUFA homeostasis. In addition, the significance of the genes previously reported in association with PUFA can be assessed relative to other regions in the genome. Here, we demonstrated that polymorphisms in the FADS cluster are the strongest determinants of plasma and erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations, explaining up to 18.6% of the additive variance in plasma AA levels. Consistent with prior reports, the greatest evidence of association was observed in the region containing FADS1, FEN1 (flap structure specific endonuclease, GeneID 2237), two hypothetical proteins (C11orf9 [GeneID 745], C11orf10 [GeneID 746]), and the promoter region of FADS2 [20],[21]. With the exception of EDA, the direction of the association of rs174537 with plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids is consistent with previous reports. We find that there are higher levels of ALA and LA which is suggestive of an accumulation of the initial products of the PUFA metabolic pathway. The cluster of SNP ranging from rs174537 to rs509360 showed the strongest evidence for association, and contains the haplotype block previously examined in relation to plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids [20],[21]. Based on the HapMap CEU data, the r2 between rs174537 and previously reported SNPs were ≥0.8. If functional polymorphisms exist within this region, it could affect the expression of both desaturases. To this end, in a recent report of genome-wide association of global gene expression, the rs174546 that is in LD with the rs174537 (r2 = 0.99) was associated with FADS1 expression (LOD = 5, P = 1.6×10−6) but not FADS2 (LOD = 0.7, P = 0.07) in lymphoblastoid cells [22],[23]. The allele associated with higher AA showed greater expression of FADS1, consistent with our results. Since FADS1 and FADS2expression varies by tissue type, it would be of interest to examine the effect of the variant on gene expression in other cell types [24].

19148276|t|The T allele associated with lower AA was also associated with decreased LDL-C and total cholesterol. The association with LDL-C was also observed in a large meta-analysis of plasma lipid concentrations in ∼8500 subjects [25],[26]. In this meta-analysis, there was stronger evidence of association with high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), where the T allele displayed lower HDL-C and higher triglyceride concentrations. Finally, in the Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium coronary artery disease (CAD) study, the T allele was associated with increased prevalence of CAD (P = 0.0375) [27]. The increased prevalence of CAD, low HDL-C and high TG is consistent with lower AA concentrations in the T allele carriers. Endogenous PUFA are natural ligands of peroxisome proliferator activating receptor alpha (PPARA) [28]. PPARA activation has been shown to elevate HDL-C and lower TG by inducing the expression of ApoA1, Apo-AII, lipoprotein lipase and suppressing ApoCIII [29]–[32]. Thus the low AA, EPA and EDA in the T allele carriers will results in lower PPARA activation. Under this hypothesis, we would expect the T allele carriers to display higher LDL-C since PPARA is known to enhance LDL-C clearance [33] . However, in both the InCHIANTI and GOLDN study, lower concentrations of LDL-C are observed. It is likely that there are other mechanisms by which fatty acids regulate lipoprotein homeostasis, for example through membrane fluidity. It may be possible, that the higher concentrations of linoleic and linolenic acid in the T allele carriers results in increased membrane fluidity, thus increasing LDL-receptor recycling leading to lower LDL-C.

19148276|t|The elongation of very long chain fatty acid (ELOVL) family genes are elongases that catalyze the rate-limiting condensation reaction resulting in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) [34]. To date, six ELOVL genes have been described. The ELOVL1, 3 and 6 are involved in synthesis of monounsaturated and saturated long chain fatty acids while ELOVL2, 4 and 5 elongate polyunsaturated fatty acids [35]. In this study, rs953413 in the ELOVL2 was the third most significant SNP in the analysis of EPA, with strong, although not genome-wide level significant association with long chain fatty acids EPA and DHA. In GOLDN, there were no significant associations of this SNP with EPA, but a significant association was observed with DPA. In mammals, two elongation steps are required for the synthesis of DHA from EPA. First, EPA is elongated to DPA, then to 24:5n-3 followed by a desaturation and retroconversion step to form DHA [1] (Figure 1). The two initial elongation steps of 20 and 22-C fatty acids are mediated by ELOVL2 [36]. The rs953413 is associated with substrate EPA (InCHIANTI), and product DPA (GOLDN) and DHA (both studies) of the EVOLV2 pathway. Plasma DPA levels were not measured in InCHIANTI, thus whether this association is also observed in this population cannot be investigated. Why the ELOVL2 SNP was not associated with EPA in GOLDN is not clear, however it may reflect the differences in fatty acid metabolism in erythrocytes versus plasma as they reflect two slightly different pools of fatty acids [37]. Plasma fatty acids reflect short term intake of fatty acids whereas erythrocyte levels reflect long term intake. Thus the different results between the plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids may reflect dietary differences between subjects in the GOLDN (USA) and the InCHIANTI study (Italy). Regardless of these differences, the results of this study suggestive of the role of ELOVL2 in the conversion of EPA to DHA in humans. The presence of the minor (A) allele was associated with higher EPA/DPA and lower DHA. If rs953413, located in intron 1, is the functional SNP (or is in LD with the functional SNP), this variant would likely be associated with lower expression of the ELOVL2 or result in a less efficient variant of the elongase resulting in decreased elongation of EPA to DHA. In lymphoblastoid cells, this SNP was not associated with ELOVL2 expression (LOD = 0.4, P = 0.2) [22],[23]. Further investigation in other cell lines and functional analysis of the different variants is warranted.

19148276|t|In summary, we have shown that the major loci for fatty acid concentrations in both plasma and erythrocyte membranes are in genes involved in the metabolism of PUFA. The FADS locus on chromosome 11 was the major contributor of plasma fatty acid concentrations, and thus may have implications for cardiovascular disease. In addition, we have identified a second promising locus in ELOVL2 that is involved in the homeostasis of longer chain n-3 fatty acids. Future studies should investigate the interactions between dietary intake, circulating levels of fatty acids and genetic variants on risk of diseases such as cardiovascular disease.

19148276|t|The InCHIANTI study is a population-based epidemiological study aimed at evaluating factors that influence mobility in the older population living in the Chianti region of Tuscany, Italy. Details of the study have been previously reported [38]. Briefly, 1616 residents were selected from the population registry of Greve in Chianti (a rural area: 11 709 residents with 19.3% of the population greater than 65 years of age) and Bagno a Ripoli (Antella village near Florence; 4704 inhabitants, with 20.3% greater than 65 years of age). The participation rate was 90% (n = 1453) and participants ranged between 21–102 years of age. Overnight fasted blood samples were collected for genomic DNA extraction and measurement of plasma fatty acids. Genotyping was completed for 1231 subjects using the Illumina Infinium HumanHap 550 genotyping chip (ver1 and ver3 chips were used). The study protocol was approved by the Italian National Institute of Research and Care of Aging Institutional Review.

19148276|t|There were 85 parent-offspring pairs, 6 sib-pairs and 2 half-sibling pairs documented. We investigated any further familial relationships using IBD of 10,000 random SNPs using RELPAIR and uncovered 1 parent-offspring, 79 siblings and 13 half-sibling [39]. We utilized the correct family structure inferred from genetic data for all analyses. In addition, we identified 2 duplicated samples and removed these from the study. Sample quality was assessed using the GAINQC program (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/GainQC/). The average genotype completeness and heterozygosity rates were 98% and 32% respectively. We excluded subjects that had less than 97% of genotyped completeness (n = 12), heterozygosity rate of less than 30% (n = 5) and misspecified sex based on heterozygosity of the X chromosome SNPs (n = 1). The final sample size used for SNP quality control was 1210.

19148276|t|The confirmation study population consisted of 1120 white men and women in the United States participating in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) Study. The majority of participants were re-recruited from the ongoing National Heart and Lung and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) Family Heart Study (FHS) [40] in two genetically homogeneous centers (Minneapolis, MN and Salt Lake City, UT). GOLDN is part of the Program for Genetic Interactions (PROGENI) Network, a group of NIH-funded intervention studies of gene-environmental interactions. The primary aim of the GOLDN study was to characterize the genetic components of triglycerides response following a high fat meal and hypolipedemic drug, fenofibrate. Detailed study design and methodology has been previously described [41],[42].

19148276|t|Biochemical Measurements
19148276|a|

19148276|t| InCHIANTI: Plasma fatty acid measurement methods has been described previously [43]. Briefly, blood samples were collected in the morning after a 12-hr overnight fast. Aliquots of plasma were immediately obtained and stored at −80 C. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared through transesterification using Lepage and Roy’s method with modification [44],[45]. Separation of FAME was carried out on an HP-6890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett- Packard, Palo Alto, CA) with a 30-m fused silica column (HP-225; Hewlett-Packard). FAMEs were identified by comparison with pure standards (NU Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MA). For quantitative analysis of fatty acids as methyl esters, calibration curves for FAME (ranging from C14:0 to C24:1) were prepared by adding six increasing amounts of individual FAME standards to the same amount of internal standard (C17:0; 50xg). The correlation coefficients for the calibration curves of fatty acids were in all cases higher than 0.998 in the range of concentrations studied. Fatty acid concentration was expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids. The coefficient of variation for all fatty acids was on average 1.6% for intraassay and 3.3% for interassay. HDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides were determined using commercial enzymatic tests (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was computed with the Friedewald formula (LDL-C = total cholesterol − HDL-C − triglicerides/5).

19148276|t| GOLDN: Fatty acids (FA) in erythrocyte membrane were measured following procedures described previously [46] Briefly, lipids were extracted from the erythrocyte membranes with a mixture of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), collected in heptanes and injected onto a capillary Varian CP7420 100-m column with a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a HP6890A autosampler. The GC was configured for a single capillary column with a flame ionization detector and interfaced with HP chemstation software. The initial temperature of 190°C was increased to 240°C over 50 minutes. Fatty acid methylesters from 12:0 through 24:1n9 were separated, identified and expressed as percent of total fatty acid. Triglycerides were measured using a glycerol blanked enzymatic method (Trig/GB, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) and cholesterol was measured using a cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase reaction (Chol R1, Roche Diagnostics Corporation) on the Roche/Hitachi 911 Automatic Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Corporation). For HDL-cholesterol, the non-HDL-cholesterol was first precipitated with magnesium/dextran. LDL-cholesterol was measured by a homogeneous direct method (LDL Direct Liquid Select Cholesterol Reagent, Equal Diagnostics, Exton, PA).

19148276|t|Assessment of Dietary Intake
19148276|a|

19148276|t|In the InCHIANTI, dietary intake was assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) created for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study, and has previously been validated to provide good estimates of dietary intake in this study population [47],[48]. In GOLDN, habitual dietary intake was estimated using the validated dietary history questionnaire (DHQ) developed by the National Cancer Institute [49]. We excluded subjects that reported <800 kcal and >5500 kcal in men and <600kcal and >4500kcal in women.
19148276|a|

19148276|t|Genotyping
19148276|a|

19148276|t| InCHIANTI: Genome-wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanHap550 genotyping chip (chip version 1 and 3) as previously described [50]. The SNP quality control was assessed using GAINQC. The exclusion criteria for SNPs were minor allele frequency <1% (n = 25,422), genotyping completeness <99% (n = 23,610) and Hardy Weinberg-equilibrium (HWE) <0.0001 (n = 517). 
19148276|a|

19148276|t| GOLDN: Five SNPs were selected for replication in the GOLDN study: rs953413, rs2277324, rs16940765, rs17718324 and rs174537. One of these, rs2277324, failed genotyping and therefore another SNP in high LD, rs923838 (r2 = 0.89 in hapmap), was used as a proxy for this SNP. DNA was extracted from blood samples and purified using commercial Puregene reagents (Gentra System, Inc.) following manufacturer’s instructions. SNPs were genotyped using the 5’nuclease allelic discrimination Taqman assay with allelic specific probes on the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applies Biosystems, Foster City, Calif, USA) according to standard laboratory protocols. The primers and probes were pre-designed (the assay -on -demand) by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystem) (Assay ID: FEN_rs174537: C___2269026_10, HRH4_rs16940765: C__32711739_10, SPARC_rs17718324: C__34334455_10, ELOVL2_rs953413: C___7617198_10, rs923828: C___2022671_10).

19148276|t|Statistical Analysis
19148276|a|

19148276|t| InCHIANTI GWAS: Inverse normal transformation was applied to plasma fatty acid concentrations to avoid inflated type I error due to non-normality [51]. The genotypes were coded 0, 1 and 2 reflecting the number of copies of an allele being tested (additive genetic model). For X-chromosome analysis, the average phenotype of males hemizygous for a particular allele was treated assumed to match the average phenotype of females homozygous for the same allele. Association analysis was conducted by fitting simple regression test using the fastAssoc option in MERLIN [52]. Narrow heritability reflects the ratio of the trait’s additive variance to the total variance [51],[53]. In all the analyses, the models were adjusted for sex, age and age squared. The genomic control method was used to control for effects of population structure and cryptic relatedness [54]. An approximate genome-wide significance threshold of 1×10−7 (∼0.05/495343 SNPs) was used. For each fatty acid concentration, a second analysis included the most significant SNP from the first pass analysis as a covariate. Linkage disequilibrium coefficints within the region of interest were calculated using GOLD [55].

For the additive model, genotype coding was based on the number of variant alleles at the polymorphic site. With no significant sex modification observed, men and women were analyzed together. We used the generalized estimating equation (GEE) linear regression with exchangeable correlation structure as implemented in the GENMOD procedure in SAS (Windows version 9.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to adjust for correlated observations due to familial relationships. Potential confounding factors included study center, age, sex, BMI, smoking (never, former and current smoker), alcohol consumption (non-drinker and current drinker), physical activity, drugs for lowering cholesterol, diabetes and hypertension and hormones. A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

20003343|a|

20003343|t|Many experimental data evidence that over-expression of various growth factors cause disorders in cell proliferation. The role of the Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) in growth control is indisputable: in particular, FGF1 and its tyrosine kinase receptor (FGFR1) act through a very complex network of mechanisms and pathways. In this work we have evaluated the antiproliferative activity effect of PD166866, a synthetic molecule inhibiting the tyrosin kinase action of FGFR1.

20003343|t|The bioactivity of the drug was investigated on Hela cells. Cytoxicity was assessed by the Mosmann assay and by vital staining with trypan blue. The target of the molecule is most likely the cell membrane as shown by the significant increase of the intracellular concentration of malonyl-dihaldheyde. The increase of this compound, as a consequence of the treatment with PD166866, is suggestive of membrane lipoperoxidation. The TUNEL assay gave a qualitative, though clear, indication of DNA damage. Furthermore we demonstrate intracellular accumulation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase I. This enzyme is a sensor of nicks on the DNA strands and this supports the idea that treatment with the drug induces cell death.

20003343|t|Conclusions
20003343|a|

20003343|t|Data presented in this work show that PD166866 has clear antiproliferative effects. The negative control of cell proliferation may be exerted through the activation of the apoptotic pathway. The results of experiments addressing this specific point, such as: evaluation of DNA damage, lipoperoxidation of the cell membrane and increase of expression of PARP, an enzyme directly involved in DNA repair. Results suggest that cells exposed to PD16866 undergo apoptosis. However, concomitant modes of cell death cannot be ruled out. The possible use of this drug for therapeutic purposes is discussed.

20003343|t|Background
20003343|a|

20003343|t|The dys-regulation of growth factor expression leads to alterations of cell functions such as growth control and proliferation [1,2]; as a matter of fact the role of these factors as well as that of their tyrosine kinase receptors in growth regulation is now a well established notion. This action is exerted through a myriad of mechanisms and pathways and their involvement in biological processes ranging from differentiation to apoptosis has been amply demonstrated [3-6].

20003343|t|The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of a synthetic molecule, PD166866, which is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase function exerted by FGFR1. In addition to PD166866 other tyrosine kinase inhibitor molecules, such as SU 4984 and SU 5402 have been described. These compounds show a very high selectivity towards FGFR1 and inhibit the auto-phosphorylation activity of FGRF1, however PD166866 shows an about 100-fold higher activity [7]. Other biological activities have been ascribed to these compounds and it is generally accepted that they may find a possible application for the control of proliferation both of normal and tumor cells [8-10]. The results presented here extend a previous study where the activity of PD166866 was assayed on a normal murine fibroblast cell line in culture [10]. The impact of this drug on the overall cell metabolism was also investigated in a previous work from our laboratory [11].

20003343|t|Here we evaluate the bioactivity of the drug versus a human tumor cell line (HeLa). The growth inhibition monitored in this study strongly suggests that it may derive from DNA damage and activation of cell death processes most likely of apoptotic nature. Therefore a future clinical use for the control of proliferative pathologies may be envisaged.

20003343|a|

20003343|t|Cell viability was evaluated by the colorimetric Mosmann assay [12] which is a quantitative method measuring the level of mitochondrial damage. The MTT [3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol-2-yl)-2,5-difenil tetrazolium-bromide] is a yellow water soluble salt which is converted into insoluble purple salts formed by the active dehydrogenases present in the mitochondria of vital cells. Absorbance values measured at 570 nm provide the number of vital cells. The cell survival data were validated by vital staining with trypan blue performed by a standard laboratory protocol.

Briefly, the assay is based on a quantitative analysis of the intra-cellular formation of malonyl-dialdheyde (MDA) which derives from the decomposition of poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The MDA molecule reacts with a chromogenic compound (N-methyl-2-phenylindole) thus forming a stable chromophore. Absorbance at 586 nm is directly transformed in intracellular concentration of MDA [13].

20003343|t|The activation of the endogenous DNases is one of the consequences of cell death causing the formation of single strand nicks and eventually fragmentation of DNA. The DNA ruptures may be evidenced by in situ labelling. Cell nuclei are permeabilized, fluorescent dUTP is added and terminal-deoxynucleotide-transferase conjugates the nucleotide where the sugar-phosphate backbone is interrupted. Fluorescence intensity provides a qualitative idea of DNA damage [14].

20003343|t|The enzyme PARP is activated in response to DNA fragmentation. The immunolocalization of PARP was performed as previously published [15]. Briefly, HeLa cells were treated with PD166866 for 24 hours, the growth medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 1 hour at 25°C adding a freshly made paraformaldheyde solution (4% in PBS). Samples were washed again with PBS and the endogenous oxidases were blocked for 2 minutes in the dark. Further washes with PBS followed and blocking the unspecific sites was done for 1 hour at 25°C. PARP was evidenced by immunolocalization utilizing a polyclonal antibody (PARP H-250 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), directed against the N-terminal proteolytic fragment. Immuno-reaction was revealed by a secondary anti-rabbit antibody after incubation for 16 hours at 4°C. After exhaustive washing with PBS the samples were incubated for 30 minutes in solution ABC (Vectastain ABC-POD Elite, PK-6101 kit, used according the supplier's recommendations). Eventually, DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) was added and the samples were incubated for 10 minutes in the dark. The samples were washed again the plates were sealed and ready for microscopic observation (Zeiss Axiophot).

20003343|t|We explored the dose/response effect of HeLa cells exposed to a relatively broad range of PD166866 concentrations (0.1 - 50 μM). Cells were treated for 24 hours with the drug and their vitality assessed by the MTT assay [12]. A significant reduction of vital cells can be monitored already at 2.5 μM concentration (Figure 1, left panel). The loss of viability seems to stabilize at 25 μM (about 25% survival) with no further decrease at a 50 μM concentration of drug. This result may indicate the presence of a cell subpopulation, intrinsically resistant to the drug. This result was confirmed by vital cell count with trypan blue (only the data obtained at 2.5 μM of drug is shown; Figure 1, right panel). The negative effect of PD166866 on the cell growth was already observed in a previous works performed on 3T6 cells: a stabilized murine fibroblast line [10,11]. The results presented here validate those already published and, as far as cell survival is concerning, no difference can be monitored on HeLa in comparison to 3T6 cells in matching experiments also run in this work (not shown). Interestingly, as observed in a former study, HeLa cells showed a significantly higher sensitivity than murine cells towards resveratrol, a natural product showing both cytotoxic and antiviral properties [16]. One way to rationalize this data is that the cellular/molecular target of the two drugs could be different.

20003343|t|The lipoperoxidation assay is a very powerful tool to evaluate in a quantitative manner the membrane damage deriving from phenomena of oxidative stress. The formation of poly-unsaturated acids, consequent to this stress, causes the formation malonyl-dihaldeyde (MDA) and of 4-hydroxyhalkenals. The concentration of intracellular MDA, a compound normally not found in the cytoplasm, is correlated directly to the extent of the membrane damage [13]. In this experiment we treated the cells with PD166866 (50 μM) or with H2O2 which, like other oxygen reactive species is a very well known inducer of oxidative stress in animal and plant cell as well as in diverse pathologies [17-19].

20003343|t|The results of Figure 2 (central bar) show that that treatment with the drug causes an over 4-fold increase of the intracellular concentration of MDA: thus PD166866 induces an oxidative stress with consequent membrane damage. However, one should not be misled by the much higher level of MDA generated by H2O2 (Figure 2 left bar) since the concentration and the power of this compound is by no means comparable with that of PD166866 in this experimental context. Finally, it is known that an uncontrolled oxidative stress may lead to apoptotic cell death [20,21]. Therefore, we analyzed an additional marker diagnostic of apoptosis: DNA damage.

20003343|a|

20003343|t|The TUNEL assay is an experimental protocol allowing the detection of DNA fragmentation. The specificity of this assay has been disputed but modifications done to the original method [21] improved its accuracy [22]. Therefore, it is generally accepted that the correct execution of the TUNEL protocol mainly labels DNA fragmentation in very advanced phases of apoptosis [23,24] thus evidencing cells that have sustained severe DNA damage.
20003343|a|

20003343|t|The cells were treated with PD166866 in the usual experimental conditions (50 μM for 24 hours). Results show a very evident fluorescent staining of the cells treated with the drug (Figure 3, large panel) which is a sign of extensive DNA rupturing. In the positive control, cells treated with H2O2 also a very diffuse fluorescence is visible (Figure 3, left small panel). On the contrary, little if any fluorescence is monitored in control plates (Figure 3, right small panel). Therefore we can conclude that in cells treated for 24 hours with PD166866 the apoptotic pathway is in progress.

20003343|t|Discussion
20003343|a|

20003343|t|The family of Growth Factor Receptors (FGFR) is constituted by tyrosine kinases involved in a number of different cell functions ranging from cell growth control to mytogenesis and differentiation. Consequently, the interruption of the tyrosine-kinase signal transduction is considered a powerful strategy to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation: therefore fibroblast growth factors and their high-affinity receptors play a crucial role for cell growth survival and maintenance. The interplay between growth factors and their receptors is indeed a very complex one; however, the overall emerging picture is that PD166866, as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is able to invalidate the protective action exerted by different agents inducing apoptosis [30,31]. In any case, inhibition of the FGF receptors mediated by small molecules such as SU5402 and PD166866 have been recently shown to reduce growth, survival and motility, as well as clonogenic potential in non small cancer lung cell lines (SSCLC) [32]. The data reported here indicate that one of the cellular targets of the drug may be the membrane of the HeLa cells which is agreement with the membrane localization of the FGFR. The treatment with PD166866 apparently causes a mitochondrial deficit and an oxidative stress, as demonstrated respectively, by the MTT assay and by the increase of the intracellular concentration of malonyl-dihaldeyde. However, rationalizing how the drug could activate these processes is not an easy task. In any case, the impact of PD166866 on the overall cell metabolism [11] cannot be disregarded as an element of serious perturbation of the cell homeostasis. It may be argued that apoptosis could not be the only death process activated by PD166866. Concerning this particular aspect, the role of PARP in executing the cell death program should be discussed in more detail. In our immunoblotting experiments, PARP-1 was revealed by an antibody directed towards N-terminal fragment of the enzyme thus indicating that proteolytic cleavage, mediated by caspases, actually occurs in our experimental model: therefore DNA repair operated by PARP cannot longer occur and the cells exposed to PD166866 proceed into the apoptotic death.

20003343|t|However, it has been shown that in necrotic death, cleavage of PARP-1 is caspase resistant and its proteolysis is partly or totally caused by lysosomal proteases [33]. Also PARP is not proteolytically cleaved by caspases during apoptosis in hepatocytes [34]. A recent literature report demonstrated that cell death may occur in a caspase-independent manner (CICD, Caspase Independent Cell Death) also defined as necroptosis [35]. Finally, a further form of cell death has been described recently which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy and is termed parthanatos. This is a PARP-1-dependent ubiquitarious form of cell death involved in all tissues of the organism and in pathologies as diverse as Parkinson's disease, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and ischemia [36].
20003343|a|

20003343|t|The overall conclusion drawn from the evidence presented here is that cells treated with PD166866 mainly die by apoptosis; however the possibility that different forms of cell death may occur contemporarily should be also taken into account. In any case, apart from the mode of death, the results discussed in this work corroborate the idea that PD166866 is able to control in a negative fashion the cell proliferation. With respect to this, the most interesting aspect of the work is that PD166866 is able to inhibit the proliferation of cultured human tumor cells.

20003343|t|Conclusions
20003343|a|

20003343|t|The results presented here show that the synthetic molecule PD166866 has significant anti-proliferative effects. These data were obtained by the colorimetric assay of Mosmann and further validated by vital cell count after trypan blue dying. The TUNEL assay allowed a qualitative assessment of DNA damage which could be one of the reasons leading to cell death: however the possibility of this fluorescent staining to discriminate between apoptosis and necrosis has been long discussed. Therefore we ascertained the type of cell death by immunoprecipitation assays of PARP, enzyme an involved in DNA repair whose expression is enhanced during apoptosis. The extensive immunopositivity monitored in the samples treated with PD166866 allows us to conclude that this drug causes cell death possibly via the activation of the apoptotic pathway, even though other forms of cell death cannot be ruled out. In addition, the results of the lipoperoxidation assays, which indicate an oxidative stress at membrane level, suggest that this cell district could be a target for this molecule. However, further studies are needed to assess the antitumor potential of PD166866: in particular future studies in vivo, in animal model systems, are required to elucidate this aspect.

20576164|t|Results
20576164|a|

20576164|t|FLLL32 specifically reduced STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 (pSTAT3) and induced apoptosis at micromolar amounts in human melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma cultures as determined by annexin V/propidium iodide staining and immunoblot analysis. FLLL32 treatment reduced expression of STAT3-target genes, induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. FLLL32 displayed specificity for STAT3 over other homologous STAT proteins. In contrast to other STAT3 pathway inhibitors (WP1066, JSI-124, Stattic), FLLL32 did not abrogate IFN-γ-induced pSTAT1 or downstream STAT1-mediated gene expression as determined by Real Time PCR. In addition, FLLL32 did not adversely affect the function or viability of immune cells from normal donors. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), FLLL32 inhibited IL-6-induced pSTAT3 but did not reduce signaling in response to immunostimulatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL 2). Treatment of PBMCs or natural killer (NK) cells with FLLL32 also did not decrease viability or granzyme b and IFN-γ production when cultured with K562 targets as compared to vehicle (DMSO).

20576164|t|Background
20576164|a|

20576164|t|Malignant melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer, and its incidence is rising faster than that of any other cancer. The prognosis for patients with metastatic disease is poor, and even the most effective therapies produce an overall response rate of only 10-15%. Therefore, novel approaches for treating this disease are urgently needed.
20576164|a|

20576164|t|Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) in melanoma tumors is associated with poor prognosis [1-3]. This transcription factor can promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis, inhibit apoptosis, and drive invasion and metastasis [1-3]. Constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation is mediated by several upstream kinases (e.g. Jak2, Src) and is thought to be a key component of the oncogenic process [4,5]. Despite its necessity in early embryogenesis, STAT3 appears to be largely dispensable in most normal adult cell and tissue types [6,7]. These data suggest that STAT3 inhibition represents a rational approach to therapy for this disease.
20576164|a|

20576164|t|Emerging data suggest that natural products may represent effective candidate molecules for drug discovery. Curcumin, 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadien-3,5-dione, is one such candidate [8] based on its chemopreventative and therapeutic properties in experimental models including melanoma and its ability to inhibit a variety of targets including STAT3 [9-11]. Administration of curcumin has been shown to be safe in humans [12,13], however its clinical utility is somewhat limited due to the poor bioavailability and target selectivity. The lack of selectivity is due to the numerous molecular targets with which curcumin is known to interact. Therefore, efforts are underway by our group and others to design and synthesize novel curcumin analogs to focus its inhibitory activity toward the STAT3 pathway [14]. Indeed prior studies by our group have shown that despite its direct pro-apoptotic effects on human melanoma cells, curcumin inhibits the cellular response to clinically relevant cytokines [15]. These data suggest that structural analogs of curcumin which retain the ability to inhibit the STAT3 oncogenic signaling pathways while leaving the STAT1 tumor suppressor pathway, and immune effector function intact could be most useful for cancer therapy.

20576164|t|The molecular structure of curcumin indicates that the molecule exists in two distinct tautomeric forms: 1) a diketone form and 2) a keto-enol form, which each have unique properties relevant for drug design (Figure 1A). We developed a series of analogs based on curcumin in its diketone form which were predicted by computational modeling to interact with the SH2 domain of STAT3 [16] and inhibit STAT3 homodimerization (unpublished observations, Dr. Pui-Kai Li, The Ohio State University). One analog, termed FLLL32, was selected as a candidate for inhibition of the Jak2-STAT3 pathway (Figure 1A). This analog has previously been shown to inhibit the Jak2-STAT3 pathway and elicit anti-tumor activity against pancreatic and breast cancer cells [16].

(A) The molecular structure of curcumin indicates that the molecule exists in two distinct tautomeric forms: 1) a diketone form and 2) a keto-enol form.

These primary melanoma cell cultures have been previously described by our group [17]. Cells were treated for 48 hours with the indicated concentrations of FLLL32 or curcumin (20 mM) as a biologic control and analyzed by immunoblot. Membranes were probed with β actin as a loading control and all blots represent data from at least two independent experiments.

20576164|t|In the present report we have characterized the biologic activity of the FLLL32 curcumin analog on human melanoma and immune effector cells. Our data indicate that FLLL32 can inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and promote caspase-dependent apoptosis of human melanoma cells at concentrations 10-fold lower than curcumin [15]. FLLL32 displayed a greater specificity for STAT3 than curcumin or other comparable inhibitors. This compound did appear to alter the activation of other structurally similar STAT proteins, as interferon-induced STAT1 signaling and gene expression were intact in the presence of FLLL32. Treatment of PBMCs with FLLL32 also eliminated basal and IL-6 induced pSTAT3. In contrast, FLLL32 did not adversely affect the response of PBMCs to stimulation with IFN-γ and IL 2 or the viability and cytotoxicity of NK cells. These data suggest that FLLL32 represents a promising lead compound that can be optimized further for development as a therapeutic agent in melanoma.

20576164|t|STAT3 DNA binding was measured with the Pierce LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit used according to manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Rockford, IL). Nuclear protein was collected using the NucBuster™ Protein Extraction kit (EMD Chemicals Inc, Gibbstown, NJ). Binding reactions using equal amounts of nuclear protein were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature with DNA probes. A biotinylated STAT3 binding sequence in the human survivin promoter (sense 5'-GAGACTCAGTTTCAAATAAATAAATAAAC-3') was purchased from Operon Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL). Reactions with biotinylated target DNA only and nuclear protein with biotinylated target DNA and excess unlabelled target DNA to compete for binding were included. STAT3 specificity was confirmed by incubation with 6μg of anti-STAT3 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) to interfere with the protein-DNA complex. Following electrophoresis, DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, cross-linked and detected by chemiluminescence.

20576164|t|The pro-apoptotic effects of FLLL32 (Figure 1A) were examined by flow cytometry following Annexin V/PI staining of a panel of metastatic human melanoma cell lines with basal STAT3 phosphorylation (A375, Hs294T, FO1, HT144, MEL-39) and the pSTAT3 negative 1106 MEL and 1259 MEL cell lines [17]. Dose-response studies revealed consistent induction of apoptosis in pSTAT3-positive metastatic human melanoma cell lines following a 48 hour treatment with FLLL32 as compared to DMSO (vehicle) treated cells (Figure 1B). The pSTAT3-positive A375 cell line was particularly sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of FLLL32 (IC50 = 1.3μM at 48 hours). Similar data were obtained in multiple pSTAT3 positive human melanoma cell lines (IC50 range = 1.9 -- 2.8 at 48 hours). The pSTAT3 negative 1106 MEL and 1259 MEL cell lines were poorly sensitive to FLLL32 (Figure 1B). FLLL32 was more potent than curcumin at inducing apoptosis (Figure 1C). Consistent with prior studies from our group, a 10-fold greater concentration of curcumin was required to achieve the same degree of apoptosis at the 48 hour time point [15]. FLLL32-induced apoptosis was also confirmed in pSTAT3+ human melanoma cell lines derived from other disease phenotypes, including the WM 1552c radial growth phase and WM 793b vertical growth phase lines following treatment with FLLL32 (data not shown).

20576164	0	6	FLLL32	Chemical	MESH:C548902

20576164|t|FLLL32 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 but not at Tyr727 in multiple human melanoma cell lines after a 24 hour treatment (Figure 1D). Prior studies indicated FLLL32 could inhibit Jak2 kinase activity in an in vitro cell-free assay [16]. However, we did not observe an appreciable alteration in Jak2 phosphorylation even at a concentration of 8 μM, suggesting that this compound likely acted directly against the STAT3 protein (Figure 1D). Time course studies also revealed that fulminant cell death occurred after 24 hours of continuous culture, yet exposure to FLLL32 at 2 - 4 μM for only 4 hours was sufficient to reduce pSTAT3 and induce cell death (Additional File 1: Figure S1A-B). FLLL32 did not appear to inhibit the phosphorylation of other key signaling pathways that are constitutively active in malignant cells (e.g. Src, Akt) at doses capable of inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation after 24 hours. Consistent with reciprocal activation of the p38 MAPK and STAT3 pathways [29], FLLL32 treatment led to increased levels of total p38 MAPK protein once pSTAT3 decreased (Figure 1D). Importantly, FLLL32 was capable of reducing pSTAT3 levels, cyclin D1 expression and inducing apoptosis in primary human melanoma cell cultures derived from recurrent cutaneous melanoma tumors [17] (Figure 1E). Finally, treatment of basal pSTAT3-positive human melanoma cell lines with FLLL32 for 24 hours led to reduced STAT3 DNA binding as determined by gel shift assays and expression of the STAT3-regulated genes, cyclin D1 and survivin as measured by immunoblot (Figure 2A-B).

20576164|t|The mechanism by which FLLL32 induces apoptosis was subsequently investigated in the A375 melanoma cell line. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in the processing of both initiator (caspase-8 and caspase-9) and effector caspases (caspase-3) following a 24 hour treatment with FLLL32 (Figure 3A). Treatment of with FLLL32 also resulted in a concentration-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by flow cytometry (Figure 3B). These data support the involvement of the mitochondrial amplification loop in promoting cell death in response to this treatment. Apoptosis was caspase-dependent, as culture with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) inhibited melanoma cell death as compared to culture with the Z-FA-FMK control compound (Figure 3C and Additional File 1: Figure S2). These data were confirmed at the 48 hour time point by flow cytometry following annexin V/PI staining, and by reduced PARP cleavage by immunoblot analysis (Figure 3C-D). Interestingly, reduced levels of pSTAT3 and cyclin D1 occurred following treatment of A375 cells with FLLL32 in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor (Figure 3D). These data are consistent with a mechanism that places reduced pSTAT3 and its cellular targets upstream of the caspase cascade and subsequent apoptosis.

20576164	71	77	FLLL32	Chemical	MESH:C548902

20576164|t|Since many cytokines act via homologous STAT proteins (e.g. STAT1), it was imperative to test whether FLLL32 had deleterious effects on the action of cytokines that might promote an anti-tumor response. Of concern were the effects of FLLL32 on signal transduction in response to IFN γ, a cytokine that mediates its cellular effects via phosphorylation of STAT1, and a resulting STAT1-STAT1 homodimer [25]. To test these interactions in a biologic system, we investigated the effects of FLLL32 or curcumin pre-treatment on IFN-γ-induced signaling and gene expression. Pre treatment of pSTAT3 positive A375 and Hs294T cells with FLLL32 or curcumin led to reduced pSTAT3 versus DMSO-treated cells. However, in contrast to curcumin, FLLL32 did not adversely affect IFN-γ-induced pSTAT1 (Figure 4A and Additional File 1: Figure S3). A unique advantage of FLLL32 versus other STAT3 pathway inhibitors was its apparent specificity. Despite a similar degree of cytotoxicity and the ability to reduce basal pSTAT3 in human melanoma cells (Additional File 1: Figure S4), the WP1066, JSI-124, and Stattic compounds also inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation (Figure 4B). Pre-treatment with FLLL32 also enhanced transcription of the pro-apoptotic interferon-regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) gene in response to IFN-γ stimulation as determined by Real Time PCR (Figure 4C). This IFN-γ responsive gene has been shown to be transcribed via STAT1-STAT1 homodimers binding to a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) element [25]. Consistent with our prior studies [15], IFN-γ stimulated IRF1 transcription was reduced in all cells pre-treated with curcumin (Figure 4C). The induction of IRF1 was not enhanced in the pSTAT3 negative 1106 MEL cell line (Figure 4C), suggesting that cross-reactivity of FLLL32 with STAT1 was negligible, and that IFN-γ driven gene transcription can be augmented via STAT3 inhibition. These data indicated that IFN-γ-induced signal transduction and gene expression were not reduced by FLLL32 and that its inhibitory actions were specific for STAT3 and not other homologous STAT proteins that function as tumor suppressors (e.g. STAT1) [30-33].

(A) A375 cells were pre-treated for 16 hours with FLLL32 (2 -- 14 μM) or curcumin (20 μM) and subsequently treated with IFN-γ (10 ng/mL) for 15 minutes. IFN-γ-induced pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 were evaluated by immunoblot. Total STAT1, STAT3 and β-actin were also measured to control for loading. The data were also summarized by densitometry comparing relative expression of pSTAT1 to STAT1 and pSTAT3 to STAT3.

20576164|t|STAT3 function in immune cells can promote tolerance to developing or established tumors. We therefore evaluated whether FLLL32 would affect the responsiveness of PBMCs to stimulation with clinically relevant cytokines that mediate tumor progression (IL 6), immunosurveillance (IFN-γ) or T and NK cell survival (IL 2) [34-36]. Pre treatment with increasing doses of FLLL32 reduced basal pSTAT3 in PBMCs from healthy donors and led to reduced IL-6-induced pSTAT3 in PBMCs (Figure 5A). FLLL32 pre-treatment also did not adversely affect the level of IFN-γ-induced pSTAT1 or IRF1 gene expression in PBMC (Figure 5B-C). The level of IL 2-induced pSTAT5 also was not altered by FLLL32 pre-treatment (Figure 5D). The FLLL32 compound did not decrease viability of PBMCs after a 24 hour treatment as compared to treatment with DMSO alone as determined by Annexin V/PI staining or PARP cleavage (Figure 6A-B). Similarly, NK cell viability from healthy donors cultured with IL-2 (1 nM) was not reduced following a 24 hour treatment with FLLL32 as compared to treatment with DMSO (Figure 6C). In addition, the production of granzyme b and IFN-γ by NK cells from normal donors when cultured with the K562 target cell line was not adversely affected in the presence of FLLL32 (Figure 6D). The mean difference (FLLL32 - DMSO) for granzyme b was 41.0 spots/well (95% CI: -79.0 to 161.0) and 65 spots/well for IFN-γ (95% CI: -146.0 to 277.9).

20576164|t|Discussion
20576164|a|

20576164|t|We have characterized the biologic activity of the curcumin analog, FLLL32 on melanoma and immune effector cells. The present study has demonstrated that the FLLL32 small molecule can inhibit STAT3 signal transduction and induce caspase-dependent, pro-apoptotic effects against human melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma cultures at micromolar concentrations. In contrast to curcumin and other STAT3 pathway inhibitors, IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was not altered in the presence of FLLL32. This compound did not inhibit the viability of PBMCs, NK cells or their cellular responsiveness to clinically relevant cytokines. These data show that FLLL32 represents a novel small molecule curcumin analog with STAT3 pathway specificity that will be considered as a lead compound for further drug development in melanoma.

20576164|t|FLLL32 represents a structural analog of curcumin when locked into its diketone tautomeric form. A number of favorable biologic properties resulting from these modifications have been characterized in this study. First, FLLL32 was ten-fold more potent than curcumin at inducing apoptosis of melanoma cells [15]. Second, FLLL32 did not appear to have toxic effects on either normal PBMCs or NK cells. Third, FLLL32 was designed to specifically target the oncogenic STAT3 pathway, while leaving the STAT1 pathway intact. Data from the present report indicate that in terms of in vitro specificity, FLLL32 was superior to other STAT3 pathway inhibitors or to curcumin. In fact, prior studies from our group have demonstrated that curcumin inhibited the phosphorylation of numerous STAT proteins in response to clinically relevant cytokines including IFN-γ (STAT1), IFN-γ (STAT1) and IL 2 (STAT5) [15]. These inhibitory effects of curcumin were observed in both melanoma cell lines and in PBMCs from healthy donors. As a result, design of the FLLL32 analog was focused on maximizing the target specificity for STAT3 over other STAT proteins. The present data support the STAT3 specificity of the FLLL32 lead compound, although they do not conclusively exclude that FLLL32 could modulate the phosphorylation of other unidentified kinases.

20576164|t|Numerous early generation small molecule STAT3 inhibitors (e.g. Stattic, STA-21, LLL12, S32 M2001, S3I-201) have been reported to induce apoptosis via inhibition of STAT3 activation and/or dimerization [33,37], while siRNA specific for the SH2 coding region of STAT3 could induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice bearing human xenograft tumors [32]. Finally, studies have also shown that platinum complexes can promote anti-tumor activity by virtue of their ability to inhibit STAT3 [38]. Collectively, these studies provide precedent for targeting STAT3 as a means of inducing tumor cell apoptosis. However, the specificity of many existing inhibitory strategies for STAT3 and not other STAT proteins (e.g. STAT1) or oncogenic pathways has not been validated in biological systems. An attractive aspect of FLLL32 was its specificity and activity at micromolar concentrations. Data from the present study suggest that FLLL32 represents a unique molecule that can be optimized further for inhibition of the STAT3 pathway.

20576164|t|STAT3 can promote immune tolerance in the setting of cancer and thus represents an attractive target to enhance immunotherapy (Reviewed in [39]). Recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated that the presence of constitutively active STAT3 in melanoma cells is correlated with reduced responsiveness to cytokines which act via STAT1 signal transduction [17]. These data suggest that the balance between pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 may influence cellular responsiveness to immunostimulatory cytokines and ultimately immune-mediated tumor regression [17,40]. Data from this report also shows that FLLL32 inhibited IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation within PBMCs. Of note, elevated levels of IL 6 are associated with poor prognosis in melanoma, and contribute to the generation of immunosuppressive lymphoid cell populations [41]. Finally, our studies indicate that FLLL32-mediated inhibition of STAT3 does not alter production of granzyme b or IFN γ by NK cells from normal donors when cultured with K562 targets, or their viability when cultured with IL-2. These properties are of importance based on recent murine studies showing the Jak2 inhibitor WP1193 can augment immunotherapy with IFN-α [42], and STAT3 siRNA-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides can elicit anti-tumor immune responses [43]. Together these data suggest that STAT3 pathway inhibition could be investigated further as a potential means by which to overcome immune tolerance and augment responsiveness to standard or experimental immune-based therapies.

20576164|t|Despite its improved STAT3 specificity, the FLLL32 analog retains some structural properties of its parent compound, curcumin which as expected, limit its solubility and bioavailability (data not shown). Therefore, our group is pursuing additional structural modifications or formulation approaches to further improve upon the bioavailability of this small molecule, in light of its potent and specific in vitro activity. The present results provide evidence that the FLLL32 curcumin analog represents a promising lead compound on which to base the further development of STAT3-specific inhibitors against melanoma. The ability of FLLL32 to specifically inhibit the STAT3 pathway while retaining the cellular response to cytokines with anti-tumor activity is a particular advantage that will be optimized in future pre-clinical studies.

20976297|t|The reaction of N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (bicine; bicH3) with Cd(O2CPh)2 · 2H2O in MeOH yielded the polymeric compound [Cd2(O2CPh)2(bicH2)2]n(1). The complex crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P41212. The lattice constants are a = b = 12.737(5) and c = 18.288(7) Å. The compound contains chains of repeating {Cd2(O2CPh)2(bicH2)2} units. One CdII atom is coordinated by two carboxylate oxygen, four hydroxyl oxygen, and two nitrogen atoms from two symmetry-related 2.21111 (Harris notation) bicH2 − ligands. The other CdII atom is coordinated by six carboxylate oxygen atoms, four from two bicH2 − ligands and two from the monodentate benzoate groups. Each bicinate(-1) ligand chelates the 8-coordinate, square antiprismatic CdII atom through one carboxylate oxygen, the nitrogen, and both hydroxyl oxygen atoms and bridges the second, six-coordinate trigonal prismatic CdII center through its carboxylate oxygen atoms. Compound 1 is the first structurally characterized cadmium(II) complex containing any anionic form of bicine as ligand. IR data of 1 are discussed in terms of the coordination modes of the ligands and the known structure.

20976297|t|1. Introduction
20976297|a|

20976297|t|There are many areas illustrating the importance of cadmium coordination and bioinorganic chemistry and the need for further research in this field. The mobilization and immobilization of CdII in the environment, in the organisms, and in some technical processes can depend significantly on the complexation by chelating organic ligands []. For example, anthropogenic chelators released into the environment, humic acids, and several types of ligands produced by microorganisms contribute to the transfer of this metal ion between solid and aqueous phases []. Examples of applied cadmium coordination chemistry are found in wastewater treatment and organic separation problems [, ]. Cadmium is also important in the interdisciplinary field of Bioinorganic Chemistry. Though CdII probably does not have any biological function, the body of a normal human adult usually contains some milligrams of it [], mainly in metallothioneins, where it is tightly bonded to cysteinyl sulfur atoms []. In special cases of cadmium poisoning, the so-called “chelation therapy” can be applied in which synthetic chelators, like EDTA4− and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL), are given as antidotes []. A number of research groups have been also using 113Cd NMR spectroscopy as a “spin spy” in the study of ZnII-containing proteins []. Systematic comparative studies on the coordination chemistry of CdII and ZnII with ligands containing donor groups of biological relevance are useful in this topic. The stereochemical adaptability of this d10 metal ion favours structural variations, and this fact makes CdII a central “player” in the fields of Crystal Engineering and Metallosupramolecular Chemistry [, ].

20976297|t|Amongst the ligands that have never been used for the preparation and study of CdII complexes, neither in the solid state nor in solution, is N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine, generally known as bicine (bicH3, Scheme 1). This is a currently “hot” ligand in Bioinorganic Chemistry. Bicine was first prepared in 1926 by Kiprianov and subsequently became a widely used buffer substance in many biochemical studies []. As with its parent compound, the amino acid glycine (glyH) also shown in Scheme 1, the monoanion of bicine, that is, the bicinate (−1) ion (bicH2 −), forms metal complexes. The stability constants of many divalent transition metal complexes of bicinate (−1) have been determined, and it has been found that the [M(bicH2)(H2O)x]+ species is always the predominant species in solution []. It has repeatedly emphasized [–] that as a consequence of its strong complexation properties, the use of bicine as a pH buffer in biochemical or medical studies under the assumption that only little (or no) interaction with divalent metal ions occurs is not justified. It has been shown that not only do bicH3 and related compounds buffer H+ concentrations but also the resultant metal complexes buffer H+ and metal ion concentrations; therefore the employment of bicH3 as a buffer requires great care to avoid conflicting data and erroneous conclusions [–]. Even though bicinate metal complexes have been studied in solution for years [–], mainly through the excellent research of Sigel [], only few metal complexes have been structurally characterized in the solid state through single-crystal, X-ray crystallography. In those structural studies it was found (see “Results and Discussion”) that the anionic bicH2 −, bicH2−, and bic3− ligands are versatile and behave in a variety of terminal and bridging modes. Due to this versatility, the anionic forms of bicine are promising ligands for the isolation of polynuclear transition metal complexes (clusters) [, ]. Transition metal cluster chemistry is a currently “hot” research field in contemporary inorganic chemistry [].

20976297|t|All manipulations were performed under aerobic conditions using materials and solvents as received. Cd(O2CPh)2·2H2O was prepared by the reaction of Cd(O2CMe)2·2H2O with an excess of PhCO2H in CHCl3 under reflux. C, H, and N analyses were performed with a Carlo Erba EA 108 analyzer. IR spectra (400–450 cm−1) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer PC16 FT-IR spectrometer with samples prepared as KBr pellets.

20976297|t|2.1. X-ray Crystallography
20976297|a|

20976297|t|X-ray data were collected at 298 K using a Crystal LOGIC dual Goniometer diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The appropriate crystal was mounted in air and covered with epoxy glue. Unit cell dimensions were determined and refined by using the angular settings of 25 automatically centered reflections in the range 11 < 2θ < 23°. Intensity data were recorded using a θ–2θscan. Three standard reflections showed less than 3% variation and no decay. Lorentz polarization and Ψ-scan absorption corrections were applied using Crystal Logic software. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 [] and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F 2 with SHELX-97 []. Hydrogen atoms were located by difference maps and refined isotropically, except those on O(3), C(6), and C(15) which were introduced at calculated positions as riding on bonded atoms with U equal 1.3 times the U(eq) of the respective atom. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. CCDC 771321 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

20976297|t|Treatment of bicH3 with 1.5 equivalent of Cd(O2CPh)2·2H2O in refluxing MeOH gave a colourless solution from which complex [Cd2(O2CPh)2(bicH2)2]n(1) was obtained in 60% yield (based on the ligand). Its formation can be represented by the stoichiometric equation

20976297|t|The “wrong” CdII to bicH3 reaction ratio (1.5 : 1) employed for the preparation of 1 did not prove detrimental to the formation of the product. With the identity of 1 established by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, the “correct” stoichiometry (1 : 1) was employed and led to the pure compound in 75% yield (see Section 2).

We repeatedly isolated a powder, analyzed as Cd2(O2CPh)(bic)(H2O)2, but we could not crystallize it; thus this second product has yet to be structurally characterized.

20976297|t|3.2. Description of Structure
20976297|a|

20976297|t|Selected interatomic distances and angles for complex 1 are listed in Table 2. The molecular structure of the compound is shown in Figure 1.
20976297|a|

20976297|t|The compound contains chains of repeating {Cd2(O2CPh)2(bicH2)2} units. Each unit contains two crystallographically independent CdII atoms [Cd(1), Cd(2)] which lie on crystallographic twofold axes. Cd(1) is coordinated by two carboxylate oxygen atoms [O(1), O(1′)], four hydroxyl oxygen atoms [O(3), O(4), O(3′), O(4′)] and two nitrogen atoms [N(1), N(1′)] from two symmetry-related bicinate(−1), that is, bicH2 −, ligands. Cd(2) is coordinated by six carboxylate oxygen atoms; four of them [O(1), O(1′′), O(2), O(2′′)] belong to two symmetry-related bicH2 − ligands, and two [O(11), O(11′′)] come from two symmetry-related monodentate PhCO2− groups. Each bicH2 − simultaneously chelates Cd(1) through one carboxylate oxygen, the nitrogen, and both hydroxyl oxygen atoms forming three stable, 5-membered chelating rings and bridges Cd(2) through its carboxylate oxygen atoms; thus, one carboxylate oxygen atom [O(1)] of bicH2 − is μ 2. Adopting Harris notation in [], the crystallographically unique bicH2 − group behaves as a 2.21111 ligand (Scheme 2).

20976297|t|The Cd-Ocarboxylate bond distances are in the wide range 2.190(3)–2.550(2) Å. The bridging Cd-O(1) distances [2.373(2), 2.550(2) Å] are asymmetric. The Cd(2)-O(1) bond distance for the bridging bicinate carboxylate oxygen atom is longer than the distance exhibited by the terminal oxygen atom [O(2)] to the same CdII atom [2.550(2) versus 2.311(4) Å]. The increase in bond length upon bridging relative to terminal ligation has been observed previously [] in complexes containing carboxylate ligands with one bridging oxygen atom. Based on theoretical and experimental studies which have indicated that the syn-lone pairs of the carboxylate group are more basic than the anti-lone pairs [], one might expect the Cd(2)-O(1) distance to be shorter than the Cd(1)-O(1) distance; however, the reverse relation holds for 1 (see Table 2). This result, which is in accordance with other CdII carboxylate complexes [], suggests that the Cd-O bond lengths involving η 1 : η 2: μ 2 carboxylate groups are mainly influenced by geometrical factors rather than the electronic properties of the carboxylate group. The Cd(2)-O bond lengths agree well with values found for other 6-coordinate cadmium(II) carboxylate complexes [, ]. The average value for the Cd(2)-O bond distances [2.350(4) Å] is smaller than that for the Cd(1)-O ones [2.435(3) Å], due to the lower coordination of Cd(2) compared to the coordination number of Cd(1) [6 versus 8]. The intrachain Cd(1)⋯Cd(2) distance is 4.739(2) Å.

20976297|t|The coordination geometry of Cd(2) can be described as a very distorted trigonal prismatic (Figure 2). The two carboxylate oxygen atoms of bicH2 − and the benzoate oxygen atom constitute each trigonal face. The angles of triangular faces are in the wide range 32.9–91.9°. The two trigonal faces are not parallel, with the planes defined by O(1)-O(2)-O(11′′) and O(11′′)-O(2′′)-O(11) making an angle of 27.6°. The coordination polyhedron of the donor atoms about Cd(1) is best described as a distorted square antiprism (Figure 3). Since even the more stable of the possible 8-coordinate geometries (square antiprismatic, triangular dodecahedral, and cubic) differ slightly in energy from one another, the geometry observed may be largely a reflection of constraints placed on the complex by ligand requirements and packing considerations.

20976297|t|Compound 1 is hydrogen bonded. Metric parameters for the bonds are listed in Table 3. The O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are intrachain. Both hydroxyl oxygen atoms [O(3), O(4)] are involved as donors, while both the coordinated [O(11)] and uncoordinated [O(12)] benzoate oxygen atoms act as acceptors. A weak interchain hydrogen bond, involving one benzoate carbon atom [C(16)] as donor and the terminally ligated carboxylate oxygen atom [O(2)] of a bicH2 − ligand from a neighbouring chain as acceptor, is responsible for the formation of a 2D network.

The broadness and low frequency of this band are both indicative of strong hydrogen bonding []. The ν(OH)bicH2− mode is situated at lower frequencies in the spectrum of 1 than for free bicH3 (at 3190 and 3090 cm−1 []); this shift is consistent with the coordination of the –OH groups.

20976297|t|Complex 1 covers a gap in literature, because it is the first structurally characterized cadmium(II) bicinate compound. The bicinate(−1) ligand adopts the extremely rare pentadentate 2.21111 coordination mode, while the two crystallographically independent CdII centers are found in two different stereochemistries.

20976297|t|The results presented here support our belief that the bicH3/RCO2 − (R = various) ligand “blends” may be effective generators of interesting structural types in the chemistry of other transition metals. Reactions of CdCl2, CdBr2, CdI2, and Cd(NO3)2 with bicH3 have not been studied to date, and we do believe that the structural types of the products will be dependent on the particular nature of the CdII source. Analogues of 1 with zinc(II) have not yet been reported, but preliminary results in our laboratories indicate completely different chemistry compared with that of cadmium(II). Synthetic efforts are also in progress to “activate” the potential of bicH2− and bic3− to bridge more than four metal ions.

21034502|t|Background
21034502|a|

21034502|t|Poly-ADP-ribosylation, a reversible post-translational modification of primarily chromosomal proteins, is involved in various cellular and molecular processes including carcinogenesis. ADP-ribose polymer or poly-ADP-ribose adducts are enzymatically added onto or stripped off the target chromosomal proteins during this metabolic process. Due to this, the chromatin superstructure is reversibly altered, which significantly influences the pattern of gene expression. We hypothesize that a decrease in the concentration of total poly-ADP-ribose adducts of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) proteins strongly correlates with the incidence of human cancer.

21034502|t|Background
21034502|a|

21034502|t|Poly-ADP-ribosylation is an enzyme catalyzed reversible post-translational modification of cellular proteins [reviewed in [1-5]]. During this process, ADP-ribose units are transferred onto or stripped off the acceptor or target proteins. Accordingly, the target protein becomes poly-ADP-ribosylated or deribosylated, respectively. The biosynthesis of the homopolymer of ADP-ribose or poly-ADP-ribose adduct(s) is primarily catalysed by the enzyme, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which is ubiquitously present in the nuclei of metabolically active cells [1,5,6]. The enzyme progressively and sequentially catalyses transfer of ADP-ribose units derived from the endogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) donors onto acceptor or target proteins creating homopolymeric adducts in a variety of linear and branched architectures. Nuclear proteins, particularly histones, are the primary targets of ribosylation [3-5]. Poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) is the main enzyme involved in the breakdown of adducts from the protein [1,3,4]. The build up of the adduct on or its breakdown from the chromosomal proteins reversibly alters chromatin superstructure and, thereby, significantly influences the pattern of gene expression [1-5]. Consequently, status of ribosylation of chromosomal proteins is intricately involved in carcinogenesis [4,5]. Previous detailed investigations done in murine model have shown that the metabolic level of the ADP-ribose adduct on total cellular proteins is significantly reduced during different stages of carcinogenesis [7-13]. These systematic studies have revealed the existence of an inverse relationship between carcinogenesis and the total ADP-ribose polymers or poly-ADP-ribose adduct level measured either in cancerous tissue or in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Therefore, we hypothesize that a decreased quantum of the total adduct of poly-ADP-ribose on human PBL proteins would also correlate with human cancer. In order to test the hypothesis, we have detected and quantified the total concentration of ADP-ribose polymer adducts of PBL proteins in healthy individuals (controls) and cancer patients (cases). PBL was chosen since PBL proteins have been shown to mirror the status of ribosylation of cellular proteins of liver, spleen, ascites cells and other tissues [10]. In addition, a blood based assay of ADP-ribose polymer adducts is the most convenient procedure to perform on humans since it is the most non-invasive medical intervention. An assay using other tissues or biopsies pose practical problems as obtaining the tissue usually requires surgical intervention. Furthermore, the immune system of the body resides in the blood. The PBL are the first responders to foreign invasions across the body. They also communicate with cells as well as cellular matrices of all tissues/organs of the body [14]. This circulating tissue, therefore, qualifies to be the sentinel of the whole body [15]. We have chosen the PBL for this reason as our aim was to identify and establish a general biomarker of cancer, which can be conveniently monitored.

21034502|t|Results & Discussion
21034502|a|

21034502|t|Blood samples were collected from new cancer patients (cases), who had not received any treatment so far, as well as from healthy volunteers (controls) in accordance with the approvals of Institutional Ethics Committees of NEHU and BBCI. The cases comprised male as well as female patients with advanced stages of cancers at 14 different sites of head & neck region (grouped as Ca H & N), breast and cervix (age range 25-80 years). The controls consisted of healthy, male and female volunteers with no known history of cancer (age range 25-80 years). Analysis of age distribution of controls and cases was done using unpaired t-test with Welch correction and χ2 test, which showed that statistically older males (P ≤ 0.0001), but not females (P = 0.4250), made the case group (Figure 1 - inset Table).
21034502|a|

21034502|t|Quantitative assay of ADP-ribose polymer adducts and analysis of controls. (a) A typical set of results of slot blot immunoprobe assay used in the study. PBL protein (500 ng per slot) samples from a control (A) and a cancer patient (B) were slot blotted on NCM in replicates of five or more. One NCM blot was stained with India ink for total protein (left panel), which also served as the loading control, and its replica slot was immunoprobed for total ADP-ribose polymer (right panel). After concentration correction, quantification of total ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins was done as mean net pixel intensity of the immunoprobed slot in arbitrary units (AU). Each sample was independently slotted thrice (3 sets) making at least 15 replicates for each sample (individual). The mean of all replicates for each sample/individual has been plotted as a dot (dark green - female (n = 27); light green - male (n = 41)) in the graphs to highlight the observed individual variance (b - d). Linear regression of the controls (r2 = 0.003676, P = 0.6233, n = 68) show that individual value fell within the range of variation (b), which was nearly the same when viewed in terms of the age of the individual (c). The control values between gender groups (male and female) were statistically (P = 0.0463) identical (d). The mean age of male cancer patients (cases) was statistically higher than the control while it was statistically identical in case of females (inset Table).

21034502|t|Overall, the cancer patients (cases) were statistically older (47.70 years) than the control counterparts (39.90 years) (Figure 1 - inset Table). The PBL protein samples (500 ng per slot) were prepared from blood samples of controls (n = 68) and cases (total n = 112). The cases comprised patients with cancers of 14 different sites grouped as Ca H & N (total n = 66), Ca breast (n = 22) or Ca cervix (n = 24). Samples were subjected to quantitative detection of poly-ADP-ribose adducts using the novel slot blot immunoprobe assay followed by densitometric analysis as described [7,8]. Figure 1 - a shows a typical slot blot stained for total proteins using India ink (left panel) and its immunoprobed replicum (right panel) for five replicate samples from a control subject (A) and a cancer patient (B). The concentration corrected mean net intensity of each control sample has been plotted as a dot to show the distribution of measured poly-ADP-ribose adduct levels in relation to sample number (Figure 1 - b), age of patient (Figure 1 - c) and gender of patient (Figure 1 - d) highlight the range of variation in measured control values in arbitrary units (AU) (mean: 14573 ± 1452 AU; range: 11950 - 17540 AU).

21034502|t|Compared to the control group, the total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins of H & N cancer patients showed a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) reduction in cancers of all 14 sites (Figure 2 - a, inset Table).

21034502|t|Quantification of ADP-ribose polymer adducts in cancer patients. (a) The graph shows the levels of ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins of each subject as a dot for cancers of different sites in the head and neck region (grouped as cancer of H & N) as compared to all controls (dark green - female (n = 27); light green - male (n = 41)). In all, 14 different types of cancers of H & N were examined in this study; for three such cancers we had only one patient each. Individually all cancers of different sites under H & N category declined significantly below the control value (see details in Table 1). The results from patients with cancers of breast and cervix have been shown in (b) and (c), respectively. Since these two cancers exclusively afflict females, the plot shows individual values of total ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins for all controls (males + females) as well as only female controls. In all three categories of cancers, the reduction in the level of total ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins was highly significant (P < 0.0001) when compared with all controls or only female controls (inset Table).

21034502|t|The overall reduction was approximately 45% with a mean of net intensity of 8060 ± 707.10 AU (range of 6324 - 10318 AU). Cancers of all sites in this group individually (Table 1) as well as collectively (Table 2) showed significant reduction as revealed by Student's t-test and ANOVA, respectively. Similarly, there were significant reductions in the total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins in cancers of breast (Figure 2 - b, inset Table) and cervix (Figure 2 - c, inset Table) in comparison to all controls (males + female controls combined) as well as only female controls. The extent of reduction in the poly-ADP-ribose adduct among the cases was 47% and 43% for breast and cervical cancers, respectively, which are statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001, unpaired t-test with Welch's correction) as shown in the inset table (Figure 2). These results are in line with previous studies done in murine model, which showed negative and statistically significant correlation between total cellular poly-ADP-ribose adduct and carcinogenesis [8-13].

21034502|t|As this report deals with elucidation of a general biomarker of cancer, the mechanistic aspects of lowering of the level of poly-ADP-ribose adduct of cellular proteins and its likely implications on the biological functions of chromatin, including gene expression, is not being discussed here. These aspects have been reviewed in details recently [5] as well as earlier [4]. It might be prudent to add that in the our considered opinion, the PBL, being the first responders of the body to sense metabolic changes and mount appropriate biological response(s), are the most appropriate cells to look for the alterations in the cellular concentration of the ADP-ribose polymer during carcinogenesis.

21034502|t|The subjects under investigations are likely to be exposed to different and variable etiological factors. Etiological factors could influence both measured poly-ADP-ribose adduct level as well as the course of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we also analysed the influence of three most important etiological factors relevant to the study on poly-ADP-ribose adduct and human cancer. The factors are habits of (a) wet variety of betel nut (BN) chewing - a social etiquette that is strongly associated with cancers, especially to cancer of H & N [reviewed in [16,17]], (b) alcohol consumption [reviewed in [18]] and (c) tobacco usage [reviewed in [19,20]].

21034502|t|These three factors did not show any statistically significant influence on the level of poly-ADP-ribose adduct in control subjects as revealed by Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney rank sum test (Table 3). However, while BN chewing did not significantly influence the total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins in cancer patients (Figure 3 - c), alcohol consumption (Figure 3 - a) and tobacco usage (Figure 3 - b) were found to lower the level of total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins in cancer patients significantly as compared to the patients without these habits (Table 4).

21034502|t|Effects of selected etiological factors on the cellular level of ADP-ribose polymer adducts in cancer patients. (a - c) The graphs show the effect of three main cancer related etiological factors on the total ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins in cancer patients following Spearman rank correlation test and Mann-Whitney rank sum test. The value for each patient is shown as a dot. Cancer patients exposed to alcohol recorded a statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001) reduction in the mean value of ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins as compared to patients not exposed to alcohol (a). Similarly, patients exposed to tobacco also recorded significantly (P = 0.0033) lower mean ADP-ribose polymer value than those not exposed to tobacco (b). In contrast, the wet variety of betel nut chewing habit of cancer patient did not seem to significantly (P = 0.0935) lower the level of ADP-ribose polymer when compared to the non-chewers (c). The values of total ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins for the age- and gender-matched (male - d; female - e) controls and cancer patients were also plotted. As is evident, the reductions in the level of ADP-ribose polymer of PBL proteins is highly significant (inset Table) suggesting that measure of ADP-ribose polymer of PBL protein is a general biomarker of cancer in humans.

21034502|t|In order to further compare the total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins in controls and cases, we matched subjects for age and gender. We obtained 28 controls (11 females and 17 males) and 56 cases (33 females and 23 males) in the age range of 24-65 years (Figure 3 - d, e and inset Table). Again a statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001) reduction (~ 47% in males and ~ 44% in females) in total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins was observed in cancer patients when compared with their age and gender adjusted controls.

21034502|t|Conclusions
21034502|a|

21034502|t|In conclusion, our findings reveal statistically highly significant negative correlation between total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins in advance human cancers of H & N (14 different types), breast and cervix in comparison to healthy controls using a novel immunoprobe assay of poly-ADP-ribose adduct. Based on the preliminary data, we conclude that poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins is a useful and general biomarker of cancers in humans. Potentially it can be used as a convenient tool for detection of cancer using the novel immunoprobe assay. The ease with which the assay could be performed along with the results presented in this report support our earlier contention [8,10-13] that the total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins can potentially be used as a tool for mass screening of cancer. We are aware of the fact that further studies on patients in early stages of different cancers and patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy, etc. would strengthen the reported findings.

21034502|t|Blood was collected in a heparinized tube from the subject. PBL was isolated from the collected blood using Histopaque separation medium as described [10]. Briefly, equal volumes of heparinized blood and balanced salt solution (BSS; pH 7.6 containing 5.5 mM anhydrous D-glucose, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.098 mM MgCl2, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.145 M Tris and 0.14 M NaCl) were mixed and layered over Histopaque. It was centrifuged at 400 × g for 40 min at room temperature (RT). The clear lymphocyte layer at the interface was drawn using a Pasteur pipette and washed twice with 3 volumes of BSS at 100 × g for 10 min at RT. The final pellet was suspended in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 and stored at -80°C until further use.

21034502|t|To prepare the whole homogenate (WH) of the isolated PBL, the lymphocytes in RPMI-1640 were pelleted down by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min at RT and washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 3.2 mM Na2HPO4, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM KCl and 135 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) at 200 × g for 10 min at 4°C. One ml of ice cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA and 3 mM MgCl2) was added to the pellet, mixed gently, incubated on ice for 30 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The protein content of the resulting supernatant, which was used for the assay of poly-ADP-ribose adducts, was estimated by Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The supernatant was stored at -20°C, whenever required, until further use.

21034502|t|The assay for total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of the WH proteins of PBL was done by a novel, slot blot immunoprobe assay developed by us, which employs PAb raised against natural, heterogeneous ADP-ribose polymers of mouse spleen cells. The novelty of the assay lies in the fact that it quantitatively measures the total cellular poly-ADP-ribose adducts irrespective of the target protein to which it may be attached. Therefore, the assay reveals the true metabolic level of total cellular poly-ADP-ribose. The assay has been described in details earlier [7,8]. Briefly, slot-blotting was carried out using a Bio-dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Samples were heat inactivated by dipping the sample tubes in a boiling water bath for 5 min. One hundred μl of sample containing 500 ng protein was loaded in each well and slot blotted on NCM under slow and regulated vacuum. The NCM was then immunoprobed for total poly-ADP-ribose adduct of PBL proteins as well as stained with India ink for total cellular proteins as previously described [8]. Immunoprobe assay involved blocking of the NCM by a 5% non-fat dry milk in tris buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) at RT, incubation in the primary PAb (1:1000) for 1 h at 37°C and incubation in the secondary antibody, ALP~IgG (1:10000), for 1 h at 37°C. Each of these steps was followed by washing twice in TBS and TTBS (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 5 min each at RT. The color on the NCM was developed by incubating the NCM in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)/nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) color developer (5-10 min) at RT.

21034502|a|

21034502|t|Immunoprobed and India ink stained slot blots were scanned (HP Scanjet 7000C) and digitized. The densitometric analysis was done using KDS-ID software (Kodak). Each sample was slot blotted in replicates of five and analysed.

21034502|t|Statistical analysis
21034502|a|

21034502|t|An unpaired t-test with Welch's correction was used to analyze the distribution of mean age. A linear regression analysis with 95% confidence bands was performed to examine the poly-ADP-ribose adduct level within the control group. A One way ANOVA was used to compare the poly-ADP-ribose adduct levels between controls and patients with cancers of the H & N region. An unpaired t-test with Welch's correction was used to compare the poly-ADP-ribose adduct levels between controls and patients with cancers of the breast and cervix. Spearman rank correlation test was performed to evaluate the correlation between poly-ADP-ribose adduct and age. χ2 test was used to examine the influence of various factors (age, gender, betel nut, alcohol, tobacco consumptions, etc.) in each of the groups. A Fisher's exact test was applied when necessary. The analysis of influence of different etiological factors in the controls and cases was performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Mann-Whitney rank sum test was also performed to compare the poly-ADP-ribose adduct levels in control and cases matched for age and gender. P value of < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. In the entire test a two-tailed P value was used.

21297899|t|Purpose
21297899|a|

21297899|t|Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is associated with impaired endothelial dysfunction, such as chronic heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and pulmonary hypertension.

21297899|t|Results
21297899|a|

21297899|t|Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by ADMA. ADMA increased intracellular ROS generation in BRCECs. The increased ROS production induced by ADMA was markedly inhibited by the angiotensin II receptor-blocker telmisartan, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril, the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium (DPI), or the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). ADMA significantly increased horseradish peroxidase (HRP) permeability in BRCECs. Benazepril, telmisartan, DPI, and NAC downregulated cell permeability. ADMA markedly upregulated ICAM-1 expression in BRCECs, which were downregulated by telmisartan, DPI, and NAC. ADMA significantly downregulated occludin expression in BRCECs. Benazepril and telmisartan upregulated occludin expression in BRCECs exposed to ADMA.

21297899|t|Conclusions
21297899|a|

21297899|t|Our results provide the first reported evidence that ADMA has potent adverse effects on cell proliferation, intracellular ROS generation, cell permeability, levels of ICAM-1, and the tight-junction protein occludin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and antioxidants are effective inhibitors of the adverse effects of ADMA.

21297899|t|Introduction
21297899|a|

21297899|t|Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is generated in the presence of type 1 protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT-1) and is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAHs) [1]. Elevated ADMA concentration in plasma is associated with impaired endothelial dysfunction, such as in chronic heart failure, hypertension, renal failure, diabetes, and pulmonary hypertension [2-4]. ADMA is also related to endothelial dysfunction in diabetic complications. Our previous studies suggested that PRMT-1- and DDAH-induced ADMA upregulation was involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-mediated diabetic retinopathy (DR), which may be a novel mechanism for the development or progression of DR [5]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or antioxidants can be used to reduce ROS production and lower ADMA concentrations, thus ameliorating endothelial dysfunction and improving prognosis in DR [5].

21297899|t|DR is a leading cause of acquired visual impairment in working-age adults in developed countries [6]. The precise mechanism underlying the progression of DR remains unclear. Several biochemical abnormalities, such as excessive nonenzymatic glycation [7], activation of the aldose reductase pathway [8], activation of protein kinase C [9], and oxidative stress [10], have been identified as being involved in the pathogenesis of DR. Oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia is thought to play a significant role in DR and to contribute to endothelial dysfunction [11]. Increases in ROS level are correlated with increased leukocyte adhesion to the retinal vasculature (leukostasis) and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) [12,13]. Breakdown of the BRB and leukostasis are hallmarks of DR. Increased leukostasis in the early stages of DR occurs through the upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [14]. Diabetes-induced BRB breakdown is associated with reduced expression of the tight-junction protein occludin, and with its redistribution within the retinal vascular endothelium [15].

21297899|t|Recent studies indicated that ADMA regulates endothelial permeability and endothelial barrier function [16]. The present study was performed to investigate whether ADMA affects cell proliferation, ROS production, cell permeability, ICAM-1, and tight-junction protein occludin expression in bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRCECs). Moreover, we observed the interfering effects of ACEI, ARB, and antioxidants on the above changes, to assess the role of ADMA in retinal capillary endothelial permeability and endothelial barrier function.

21297899|a|

21297899|t|BRCECs were cultured as described previously [17]. Briefly, BRCECs were cultured in endothelial cell medium (ECM; ScienCell Research Labs, Carlsbad, CA) consisting of 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% endothelial cell growth supplement, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Endothelial cells at passage 3–5 were used in the following experiments, including the cell proliferation assay, examination of ROS levels, permeability assay, western blotting analysis, and quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR. The cells were washed when at 80% confluence and were cultured overnight with endothelial cell basal medium, consisting of 0.4% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. The cells were then incubated with 100 μM ADMA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 100 μM ADMA plus 10 μM benazepril (Sigma), 10 μM telmisartan (Sigma), 10 μM diphenyliodonium (DPI, an reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidase inhibitor; Sigma), or 10 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant and free radical scavenger; Sigma). The control group was cultured in endothelial cell basal medium, consisting of 0.4% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cells were harvested after 24 h for western blotting analysis, quantitative RT–PCR analysis, and examination of ROS levels.

21297899|t|Cell proliferation assay
21297899|a|

21297899|t|Cell proliferation assay was performed using the novel tetrazolium compound, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), and the electron-coupling reagent, phenazine ethosulfate (PES). PES has enhanced chemical stability, which allows it to be combined with MTS to form a stable solution. This convenient “one solution” format is an improvement over the traditional method, where phenazine methosulfate (PMS) is used as the electron-coupling reagent, and PMS solution and MTS solution are supplied separately. The MTS tetrazolium compound (Owen’s reagent) is bioreduced by cells into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. This conversion is presumably accomplished by NADPH or reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotid (NADH), produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells [18]. The quantity of formazan product, as determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm, is directly proportional to the number of living cells in the culture. Endothelial cells were plated in 96-well culture plates at an optimal density of 1×105 cells/ml with 100 μl of culture medium per well. After 3 days, cells were cultured with endothelial cell basal medium, consisting of 0.4% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, overnight. The cells were then incubated with 10 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, and 200 μM ADMA for 24–72 h. Then, 20 μl of CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) were pipetted into each well of the 96-well assay plates containing the samples in 100 μl of culture medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1–4 h in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The optical density of each sample was determined immediately on an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) microplate reader (Wallac 1420; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) at 490 nm. Samples were tested in duplicate. The corrected absorbance at 490 nm (y-axis) was plotted against the incubation time of cells with ADMA (x-axis).

21297899|t|For the permeability assay, horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 40 kDa; Sigma) was added to the upper chambers at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Aliquots of 5 μl were collected from the lower chamber after 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h. The concentrations of HRP were determined in 5 μl aliquots added to 195 μl of freshly made substrate (o-phenylenediamine, 400 μg/ml in 0.05 mM citric acid and 0.1 mM phosphate, with 0.012% hydrogen peroxidase, pH 5.0). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 0.3 mM sulfuric acid after 15 min, and optical density was determined using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) at 490 nm. A standard curve was prepared from HRP serial dilutions in each experiment, and the samples were diluted such that all readings fell within the linear range of the standard curve. The readings for each tracer were then converted to nanograms per milliliter by comparison with standard curves generated using tracer samples taken at time zero. Permeability was calculated as flux: (ml/cm2)=(X)B/[(Y)i*A], where (X)B (μg) is the level of HRP in the lower chamber, (Y)i (μg/ml) is the concentration of HRP in the upper chamber, and A (cm2) is the effective surface area of the insert. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.

21297899|a|

21297899|t|Cells were sonicated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing protease inhibitors. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged (12,000× g, 15 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. The protein content was quantified with a Pierce protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples of equal concentration (80 μg/lane) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electropheresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transfer membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies for ICAM-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or occludin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 1:1,000 dilution. After rinsing in TBS with Tween-20 (TBST), the membranes were incubated for 2 h with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in a 1:1,000 dilution and rinsed with TBST, and bands on the blots were then detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). The densities of the bands were analyzed using Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). The expression of β-actin (1:5000; monoclonal anti-β-actin; Sigma) was used as an internal control.

21297899|t|Primer sequences for quantitative RT–PCR.
21297899|a|

21297899|t|To exclude DNA interference, primers were designed to span at least one intron. To quantify the amounts of specific mRNA (mRNA) in the samples, we generated a standard curve for each run using a plasmid (pGEM-T Easy Vector; Promega) containing the gene of interest as a standard. This enabled standardization of the initial mRNA content of cells relative to the amount of 18S rRNA. PCR assays were performed using SLAN® RT–PCR system (Hongshi, Shanghai, China). The quantitative RT–PCR solution consisted of 2.0 μl of diluted RT–PCR product, 0.5 μl of each primer pair, 25 μl of RT–PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), 1.0 μl of fluorogenic probe, and 10 μl of PCR-grade water. The amplification conditions for ICAM-1 and occluding were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The results of quantitative RT–PCR were analyzed using the relative standard curve method with the SLAN software (v. 5.0). Values were normalized relative to the relative amounts of 18S rRNA, which were obtained from a similar standard curve.

21297899|t|Discussion
21297899|a|

21297899|t|Kakimoto and Akazawa [19] first isolated and described ADMA from human urine in 1970. Since their initial observation, ADMA has been shown to represent a novel risk factor for the development of endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress has been shown to increase the activity of arginine-methylating and ADMA-degrading enzymes, leading to increased ADMA concentrations; moreover, high ADMA levels further contribute to the vascular oxidative stress burden in a positive feedback fashion [20,21]. As reported previously, BRCECs incubated in the presence of high glucose concentrations showed elevated ROS production, PRMT-1 expression, reduced DDAH activity, and DDAH II expression, and increased the accumulation of ADMA in a conditioned medium [5]. In the present study, we found that ADMA increased intracellular ROS generation in BRCECs. Thus, we propose that ADMA is not only a marker, but also a producer of oxidative stress, under high-glucose conditions.

21297899|t|There have been many recent studies regarding the effects of different therapeutic interventions on ADMA plasma concentrations. ACEI and ARB have been shown to reduce the levels of ADMA and improve endothelial dysfunction in human essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus [22-24]. Although the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB remain obscure, ADMA is known to upregulate several components of microvascular RAS, leading to increased production of angiotensin II, which then activates NADPH oxidase and increases ROS production [25]. ADMA improves the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in human coronary artery endothelial cells, which may provide a link between ADMA and RAS, because ACE protein expression has been shown to be regulated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [26,27]. In the present study, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI or the free-radical scavenger NAC decreased intracellular ROS generation in BRCECs incubated with ADMA. Benazepril or telmisartan had effects similar to those from DPI and NAC, indicating that they may also exert their effects through the oxidase pathway.

21297899|t|It has been reported that ADMA regulates endothelial permeability and endothelial barrier function. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of ADMA on endothelial barrier function. A previous study indicated that ADMA increased pulmonary endothelial permeability both in vitro and in vivo, and that this effect was mediated by nitric oxide, acting via protein kinase G and independent of ROS formation [16]. Others have demonstrated that ADMA compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier by altering the bioavailability of nitric oxide and superoxide, and that nitric oxide (NO)-independent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase preserves the integrity of this barrier under conditions of NO depletion [28]. ADMA markedly downregulated connexin43 expression and damaged gap junction function in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by increasing the production of intracellular ROS and inducing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK [29]. However, to date, the role of ADMA in the BRB has not been studied.

21297899|t|The BRB, an important ocular barrier, consists of two components: the inner and outer BRB. The inner BRB is formed by retinal microvascular endothelial cells with tight junctions between them. The normal inner BRB is determined by the homeostasis of retinal microvessels, and plays a critical role in normal visual function. Enhanced retinal vascular permeability has been shown to aggravate microvascular endothelial cell damage and capillary nonperfusion [30]. Several studies linked inflammation to vascular leakage in diabetic retinopathy. Leukocytes adhere to the retinal vascular endothelium early in diabetic retinopathy, the onset of which occurs before the development of any clinical pathology [14]. Further, leukocyte adhesion coincides with the development of BRB breakdown and capillary nonperfusion [14]. The expression of ICAM-1 is upregulated in DR, and the specific inhibition of ICAM-1 prevents diabetic retinal leukocyte adhesion and BRB breakdown [14,31,32].
21297899|a|

21297899|t|In this study, ADMA significantly increased BRCEC permeability within 1 h and was strongly involved in reducing the levels of the tight-junction protein occludin and upregulation of ICAM-1 expression in BRCECs. ACEI, ARB, or antioxidants significantly downregulated cell permeability increased by ADMA at 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h. Furthermore, we observed that benazepril, telmisartan, and the antioxidant DPI reversed the effects of ADMA on occludin and ICAM-1 expression. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mechanism of ADMA damage to the BRB is partly mediated by ROS and/or RAS pathways.

21297899|t|In summary, ADMA can inhibit BRCEC proliferation, increase intracellular ROS generation, increase cell permeability and in BRCECs, can reduce levels of the tight-junction protein occludin and increase ICAM-1 expression. Further studies are required to determine the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of ADMA in diabetes-induced BRB breakdown and the roles of ACEI, ARB, and antioxidants in the control of retinal endothelial barrier function under diabetic conditions.

21291557|a|

21291557|t|Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) is a multidomain, secreted protein that is critical for the formation of tooth dentin. Mutations in DSPP cause inherited dentin defects categorized as dentin dysplasia type II and dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III. Dentin sialoprotein (Dsp), the N-terminal domain of dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp), is a highly glycosylated proteoglycan, but little is known about the number, character, and attachment sites of its carbohydrate moieties.

21291557|t|Results
21291557|a|

21291557|t|To identify its carbohydrate attachment sites we isolated Dsp from developing porcine molars and digested it with endoproteinase Glu-C or pronase, fractionated the digestion products, identified fractions containing glycosylated peptides using a phenol sulfuric acid assay, and characterized the glycopeptides by N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analyses, or LC/MSMS. To determine the average number of sialic acid attachments per N-glycosylation, we digested Dsp with glycopeptidase A, labeled the released N-glycosylations with 2-aminobenzoic acid, and quantified the moles of released glycosylations by comparison to labeled standards of known concentration. Sialic acid was released by sialidase digestion and quantified by measuring β-NADH reduction of pyruvic acid, which was generated stoichiometrically from sialic acid by aldolase. To determine its forms, sialic acid released by sialidase digestion was labeled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methyleneoxybenzene (DMB) and compared to a DMB-labeled sialic acid reference panel by RP-HPLC. To determine the composition of Dsp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachments, we digested Dsp with chondroitinase ABC and compared the chromotagraphic profiles of the released disaccharides to commercial standards. N-glycosylations were identified at Asn37, Asn77, Asn136, Asn155, Asn161, and Asn176. Dsp averages one sialic acid per N-glycosylation, which is always in the form of N-acetylneuraminic acid. O-glycosylations were tentatively assigned at Thr200, Thr216 and Thr316. Porcine Dsp GAG attachments were found at Ser238 and Ser250 and were comprised of chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate in a ratio of 7 to 3, respectively.

21291557|t|Background
21291557|a|

21291557|t|Type I collagen and proteolytic cleavage products of dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) are the predominant proteins in tooth dentin. Collagen constitutes about 90% of the dentin organic matrix, while Dspp-derived proteins make up more than half of the dentin noncollagenous proteins. Genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of the genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1, 17q21.31-q22; COL1A2, 7q22.1) and DSPP (4q21.3) for proper human dentin formation. Inherited dentin defects are classified as dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) types I, II, or III, or dentin dysplasia (DD) types I and II. DGI type I is osteogenesis imperfecta with dentinogenesis imperfecta and is caused by mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 . DD type II and DGI types II and type III are caused by mutations in DSPP . There are other potential candidate genes for these disorders, but only DSPP mutations have been found in DD or DGI kindreds.

21291557|t|Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) is a chimeric protein that is cleaved by proteases into its component parts, which are considered to be two parts in rodents and three in pig. The order of the major domains of Dspp is Dsp-Dgp-Dpp, where Dsp is dentin sialoprotein, Dgp is dentin glycoprotein, and Dpp is dentin phosphoprotein. Dspp is expressed predominantly by odontoblasts, but is detected in bone at trace levels (0.25% of the level in dentin). Currently, the human expressed sequence tag database for DSPP expression (Hs.678914) shows zero DSPP transcripts out of 71,655 total mRNA transcripts characterized from bone.
21291557|a|

21291557|t|Dspp is a member of the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) genes, which are involved in the mineralization of bone, dentin, and enamel. The SCPP family initially arose from a single ancestral gene: SPARCL1 or secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich like 1 gene. The common features of SCPP genes are few: their second exon encodes a short signal peptide (~15 amino acids in length) plus the first two amino acids of the secreted protein. The second coding exon generally encodes a phosphorylation site SXE/S(p) for Golgi casein kinase. All of the introns are type 0, that is, the introns do not interrupt codons but are all placed between codon triplets. The SCPPs divide into two groups based upon their distinctive amino acid compositions. Acidic SCPPs are rich (over 25%) in glutamate, aspartate, and phosphoserine. Proline and glutamine-rich SCPPs are more than 20% proline and glutamine. Dspp belongs to the acidic group, which is also known as the dentin/bone group or the SIBLINGs, for small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoproteins.

21291557|t|The second coding exon for Dspp (exon 3) is unusual for the SCPP family. In the pig, this exon encodes the protein segment from Val3 to Gln31. None of the amino acids encoded by exon 3 are in the appropriate context for phosphorylation or glycosylation. Skipping exon 3 would not alter the reading frame, but human mutations that cause the skipping of exon 3 cause dominant negative effects that result in dentin malformations, possibly due to failure to recognize or cleave the signal peptide. All six of the reported intronic mutations in DSPP that cause inherited dentin defects are at the end of intron 2 or beginning of intron 3. Perhaps exon 3 was acquired by exon capture after the Dspp ancestral gene duplicated from another SCPP gene and is not descended from the short prototypical second coding exon that encodes a serine that gets phosphorylated.

21291557|t|Exon 4 encodes the bulk of dentin sialoprotein (Dsp), from Asp32 to Lys368 . Previously we isolated and characterized a porcine "Dsp only" transcript. This mRNA transcript terminated at a polyadenylation/cleavage site in intron 4. The porcine Dsp cleavage product (Ile1 to Arg376) of Dspp is a highly glycosylated proteoglycan that forms covalent dimers. The Dgp cleavage product (Ser377 to Gly457) of Dspp is encoded by the 5' part of exon 5. Dgp, which has so far only been described in pig, has a single glycosylation (Asn382) and four phosphoserines (Ser438, Ser440, Ser442, Ser447) that are in a highly conserved region near its carboxyl-terminus. Dentin phosphoprotein (Dpp) is the highly phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of Dspp, and is encoded by the rest of exon 5. The coding region of Dpp varies in length among different individuals without affecting function. Astacin proteases, such as Bmp-1 cleave Dpp from Dspp, while Mmp-20 separates Dsp and Dgp.

21291557|t|Dentin sialoprotein (Dsp) was previously thought to be only a minor component of dentin, perhaps only 10% as abundant as dentin phosphoprotein (Dpp), and later thought to be a nonfunctional pro-domain that was removed by proteases to activate Dpp. Recently, however it has been determined that Dsp and Dpp are expressed in stoichiometric amounts as the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Dspp and are found in equal molar amounts in dentin. Dspp null mice show severe dentin malformations that resemble those observed in human DGI-III. Transgenic expression of the Dsp domain in the Dspp null background partially, but substantially, restores the dentin phenotype. The widening of predentin observed in the Dspp knockout as well as the reduced volume of mineralized dentin are recovered, indicating that both Dsp and Dpp are necessary for normal dentin mineralization. The mechanisms through which Dsp contributes to dentin formation are unknown. Characterization of its posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is an important step in understanding its function.

21291557|t|We previously showed that porcine Dsp is a proteoglycan and that porcine dentin extracts contain the intact Dsp (the N-terminal domain of Dspp), as well as lower molecular weight (LMW) cleavage products of Dsp. It was also known that Dsp has glycosylations rich in sialic acid and that porcine Dsp has eight potential N-glycosylation sites based upon analysis of its primary amino acid sequence. To identify attachment sites and to better characterize the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and other carbohydrate attachments in porcine Dsp, we first targeted the small glycosylated Dsp cleavage products (LMW-Dsp) from the N-terminal region of Dsp. As none of the dentin extracts are perfectly homogeneous with respect to their contents, we refer to each extract that we characterized using a notation that reflects the extraction and fractionation steps that produced it (see methods). Routine characterizations of these fractions (SDS-PAGE and Western blots) are provided in additional files online.

21291557|t|Demineralized dentin powder was subjected to a series of extraction procedures. A flow chart of the extractions is provided in Figure 1. Simple analyses of the extracts (SDS-PAGE stained with CBB and stains-all and a Dsp immunoblot) are shown in Additional file 1. Intact Dsp proteoglycan and its cleavage products containing GAG attachments segregated in the acid/NaCl or "AN" extract, which was further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. Dsp degradation products containing the GAG attachments displayed a stains-all positive smear migrating between 50- to 100-kDa on SDS-PAGE, which were collected in the third (ANS1/2-R3) of five RP-HPLC fractions (Additional file 2). ANS1/2-R3 was resolved into two final fractions by repeating the RP-HPLC run. These two fractions (ANS1/2-R3a and ANS1/2-R3b) were digested with chondroitinase ABC to degrade their GAG attachments, which converted the proteoglycan smears on SDS-PAGE into small peptides (Figure 2A) that contained no disulfide bridges, as their mobilities were not affected by the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol (Figure 2B). Chondroitinase ABC digestion converted ANS1/2-R3a into four peptides and ANS1/2-R3b into two peptides having apparent molecular weights ranging from 8- to 25-kDa (Figure 2C). These six peptides were excised and eluted from the gel (Figure 2D) and then characterized by N-terminal sequencing and by amino acid analysis (Figure 2E). The N-terminal sequence and amino acid compositions allowed the complete amino acid sequences of the six peptides to be deduced (Figure 2F).

21291557|t|Peptides 1, 2, 3 and 6 contained the putative GAG attachment site at Ser238 and the amino acid compositions for each of these proteins showed one fewer serine than expected. N-terminal sequence for peptide 3 gave a blank cylce for Ser238. The other N-terminal sequences did not reach Ser238, but the full-length of each peptide could be inferred from its amino acid composition. A blank cycle strongly suggests the presence of a posttranslational modification, but additional evidence is generally required to support this conclusion. In addition, the four peptides containing Ser238 were only 11 or 12 amino acids in length, but migrated at 15-, 17-, 19- and 20-kDa on SDS-PAGE, suggesting they retained variable lengths of GAG attachment following the chondroitinase ABC digestion. From these data we can safely conclude that Ser238 is a GAG attachment site; however, no information from this experiment was gained on the other putative GAG attachment sites on porcine Dsp (at Ser220 and Ser250). No conclusions could be made from the analyses of peptides 4 and 5. A blank cycle was observed at Thr200, but the amino acid composition suggested that this position was a threonine, and therefore not necessarily modified.

21291557|t|To gain additional information on posttranslational modifications in the GAG attachment region of Dsp, fraction ANS1/2-R3 was digested with pronase. Larger digestion products from the pronase digestion were recovered by size exclusion chromatography in the first eluted fraction (ANS1/2R3-Pr1) (Additional file 3). ANS1/2R3-Pr1 resolved into 26 fractions by RP-HPLC and each was assayed for the presence of glycosylations using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay. Glycosylated peptides were detected in eight of the RP-HPLC fractions: ANS1/2R3Pr1-d, -e, -h through -l, and -p (Additional file 3). To identify peptides with GAG attachments, the eight glycosylated fractions were digested with chondroitinase ABC. The peptides were separated from the digested carbohydrate by ethanol precipitation and each supernatant (containing the liberated GAG chains) was analyzed by phenol sulfuric acid assay. Fractions positive for glycan attachments (-d, -h, -i, -j, and -p) were rechromatographed using the same C-18 column that was used prior to the chondroitinase ABC digestion. Rechromatographed fractions showing a shift in their retention times relative to same sample prior to chondroitinase ABC digestion were characterized by N-terminal sequencing (Figure 3). One peptide (ANS1/2R3Pr1p-P2) gave a blank cycle for Ser238, while three peptides (ANS1/2R3Pr1d-D, ANS1/2R3Pr1h-H, and ANS1/2R3Pr1j-J1) gave blank cycles for Ser250. These data demonstrate that Ser238 and Ser250 are the GAG attachment sites for porcine Dsp. The N-terminal sequences of the peptides in fractions ANS1/2R3Pr1-k and ANS1/2R3Pr1-l, which were negative for GAG chains based upon the phenol sulfuric acid assay, were 211EETGVxSGGSGA and 311TDGDNxSK, respectively. The blank cycles for Thr216 and Thr316 suggest these residues are modified, but these sequences also show that Ser220 and Asn315 (which did not give blank cycles) are not modified, despite their being in appropriate contexts for GAG or N-glycosylation attachments, respectively.

Peptides ANS1/2R3Pr1d-D (with the GAG attached at Ser250) and ANS1/2R3Pr1p-P2 (with the GAG attached at Ser238) were digested by chondroitinase ABC. The released carbohydrates were obtained from the supernatant following ethanol precipitation of the peptide, and were characterized by their retention times relative to those of disaccharide standards on NP-HPLC (Figure 4). This determined that both GAG attachment sites contained chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S) and chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S), and integration of the areas under their chromatogram peaks determined that C6 S and C4 S are present in a ratio 7 to 3, respectively.

This R4 fraction (5 mg) was digested with pronase, and glycosylated peptides were collected in the first peak by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 5A). These peptides resolved into eight peaks by RP-HPLC (Figure 5B). N-terminal sequencing of these peptides gave blank cycles for Asn77, Asn155, Thr200, Thr216, and Ser250.

21291557|t|Characterization of Dsp N-linked glycosylation sites
21291557|a|

21291557|t|Previously we showed by Western blot analyses that low molecular weight (LMW) peptides from the N-terminal region of Dsp can be found in the acid or "A" extract. To identify glycosylated amino acids in these peptides, the A extract was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography followed by RP-HPLC (Additional file 4). The LMW Dsp components in fraction AS2R-g (Figure 6A) were digested with endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 endoproteinase) and the digest was fractionated by RP-HPLC (Figure 6B). Fifteen peaks were observed and each of these fractions was digested with glycopeptidase A. Following the N-deglycosylation, each sample was rechromatographed on the same C-18 column to demonstrate that deglycosylation of the glycopeptide had altered its retention time. A shift in retention time on the column following deglycosylation was accepted as evidence that the original peptide was glycosylated. Fractions corresponding to the main chromatographic peaks that were not present before the glycopeptidase A digestion (AS2R-g peaks 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 12) were characterized by LC/MSMS analysis (Figure 6C). Five N-glycosylation sites were identified: Asn37 (NDT; peaks 6, 8, 10, 11, 12), Asn77 (NSS; peaks 6, 8), Asn136 (NGS; peaks 2 and 3), Asn155 (NAS; peak 6), Asn161 (NAT; peaks 6, 8), and Asn176 (NNS; peak 2).

21291557	12	23	Sialic Acid	Chemical	MESH:D019158

21291557|t|It was known early on that Dsp glycosylations are rich in sialic acid, which was the basis for its designation as dentin sialoprotein. Sialic acid refers to N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivatives. To determine the amount of N-glycosylations in each Dspp fraction, we released the N-glycosylation with glycopeptidase A and chemically attached a fluorescent label. One fluorescent label was added per N-glycosylation. The amount of N-glycosylation in each Dsp fraction was determined by running an aliquot of labeled glycosylation over an SE-HPLC column and then comparing the areas under the chromatographic peaks to that of a commercial A2 glycan standard of known amount and fluorescence (Additional file 5). To quantify the average number of sialic acid attachments per N-glycosylation, we digested LMW-Dsp (containing N-terminal fragments of Dsp) and R5-Dsp (containing Dspp minus the Dpp domain) fractions with sialidase. The released sialic acid was digested with aldolase and the product (pyruvate) and lactic dehydrogenase were used to oxidize β-NADH to β-NAD, which was measured spectrophotometrically. The same series of reactions were conducted on a commercial standard (bovine fetuin). The results showed that there were, on average, 1.3 sialic acids per N-glycosylation in the N-terminal region of Dsp, and about 0.8 molecules of sialic acid, on average, per N-glycosylation in Dspp (Additional file 5).

21291557|t|To identify which forms of sialic acid were present on the N-linked glycosylations, N-glycosylations were released from the various Dsp fractions (LMW-Dsp, R3-Dsp, R4-Dsp, R5-Dsp), given a fluorescent label, and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Sialic acid was released from these glycosylations by sialidase digestion, labeled, and then passed through a RP-HPLC column. By comparing the retention times of the labeled sialic acid from the Dsp fractions to a similarly-labeled sialic acid reference panel it was demonstrated that all of the sialic acid attached to Dsp N-glycosylations are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA), which is the predominant form of sialic acid in mammalian cells (Additional file 5).

21291557|t|Discussion
21291557|a|

21291557|t|In this study we identified six N-linked and three tentative O-linked glycosylation and the two GAG attachment sites on porcine Dsp (Figure 7). The two GAG attachment sites are particularly interesting. Xylosyltransferase I (XYLT1; 16p13.1) and xylosyltransferase II (XYLT2; 17q21.3) catalyze the initial step in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and determine if a site will have a GAG attachment. Experimentally determined GAG attachment sites identify the range of amino acid contexts that are recognized by these enzymes and provide the data needed to improve the prediction algorythms for GAG attachment sites.

21291557|t|Porcine Dsp posttranslational modification sites. A: Diagram showing the three regions (Dsp, Dgp, and Dpp) of porcine Dspp. B: Diagram showing N and O-linked glycosylation sites identified in this study. Among the eight asparagines in the appropriate context for glycosylation, six were determined to be glycosylated (Asn37, Asn77, Asn136, Asn155, Asn161, Asn176). The glycosylation status Asn67 was not determined. Asn315 was shown to not be glycosylated, possibly due to an O-glycosylation of Thr316. In porcine Dsp, it was shown that the N-glycosylations contain, on average, one sialic acid, in the form of N-acetylneuraminic acid, per N-glycosylation. Ser238 and Ser250 were determined to be GAG attachment sites, with the GAG attachments being comprised of chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate in a ratio of 7 to 3. O-glycosylations were suggested by blank cycles at Thr200, Thr216, and Thr316 in samples that were positive for glycosylation by the phenol sulfuric acid assay and eluted early from a size-exclusion column, but no direct evidence for O-glycosylation was obtained and the conclusion that these residues are glycosylated should be considered tentative.

21291557|t|The two GAG attachment sites are in the most highly conserved area of Dsp (Additional file 6). The context for the second site (Ser250; DEEEDKGSGDDEGEE) contains a GSG-motif combined with a high number of surrounding acidic amino acids, so this sequence would be predicted to be a good acceptor for a xylosylation reaction and result in a high degree of xylosylation catalyzed by both XT-isoforms.

21291557|t|The first site (Ser238, DNSDGSPSGNGADEEED) has two acidic amino acids on the N-terminal side and a series of acidic amino acids starting at positions +5 or +6, which are positive features. However, the proline in the -1 position is thought to have an inhibitory effect on the glycosylation reaction. Despite this, our results indicate that Ser238 is a GAG attachment site. Perhaps the high conservation of the surrounding amino acids helps ensure its recognition as a target for glycosylation. Recently, it was shown that altering the potential GAG attachment sites sequences in rat Dsp diminished the apparent size of the recombinant protein on Western blots, indicating that both of the GAG attachments sites identified in this study have GAG attachments in rat Dsp.

21291557|t|It is clear from our analyses that the repeating disaccharide units attached to Ser238 and Ser250 are chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate, with C6 S predominating. Based upon antibody analyses, we previously detected only C6 S attached to porcine Dsp. Dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1) is a bone and dentin proteoglycan that plays a role in phosphate homeostasis. In rat, the predominant disaccharide unit on Dsp and Dmp1 is C4 S.

21291557|t|The role of Dsp GAG chains in dentin formation is largely unexplored. Proteoglycans such as decorin are known to regulate collagen fibrillogenesis. GAGs are thought to interact directly with dentin collagen fibrils, as an electrondense substance that can be removed from dentin collagen fibrils by chondroitinase treatment. Dsp is the most abundant proteoglycan in dentin and is therefore likely to interact with collagen. Chondroitinase activity in the dentin matrix might regulate interactions between the Dsp GAG chains and collagen.

21291557|t|Besides having two GAG attachments, porcine Dsp has at least six N-glycosylations. All of these sites are on the N-terminal side of the lone cysteine (Cys190) that covalently links two Dsp proteins into a dimer. Although a high degree of N-glycosylation is a characteristic feature of Dsp, the individual glycosylation sites are not well conserved. The N-linked glycosylations on porcine Dsp average about one sialic acid per N-glycosylation. Previously it was shown that rat Dsp contained 29.6% carbohydrate including about 9% sialic acid. Sialic acid attachments can serve a wide range of functions. Sialic acid moities can be ligands for other molecules, such as lectins. Perhaps Dsp could form a bridge between molecules that interact with sialic acid and others that interact with O-glycosylations or GAG attachments.

21291557|t|The two O-glycosylations and two GAG attachments are all on the C-terminal side of Cys190. Ser238, Ser250, and Thr216 are perfectly conserved, whereas Thr316 is conserved in all known Dsp sequences except the mouse. Thus the O-glycosylations and glycosaminoglycan attachments are structural elements that are likely to be essential for Dsp function. Three predicted Golgi casein kinase phosphorylation sites (Ser294, Ser296 and Ser319) are all found in the C-terminal side of Dsp and are perfectly conserved.

21291557|t|The map of porcine Dsp posttranslational modifications suggests that Dsp is divided into two domains that are separated by the lone cysteine (Cys190) that covalently links two Dsp proteins.

21291557|t|The Dsp domain of Dspp is not highly phosphorylated (only 3 predicted sites). In contrast, the small Dgp domain has four perfectly conserved sites, while Dpp has well over a hundred. The Dsp domain is not highly conserved. Only 73 of 377 (19%) if its amino acids are perfectly conserved among the seven mammalian Dsp sequences in GenBank, whereas 28/81 (35%) of Dgp is perfectly conserved. The most highly conserved regions of Dsp and Dgp are in areas of posttranslational modifications, highlighting their importance for function. Dsp is important for the onset of dentin mineralization, and future studies will investigate the importance PTMs in carrying out these functions.

21291557|t|Conclusions
21291557|a|

21291557|t|Dentin sialoprotein (Dsp), the N-terminal domain of dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) was isolated from developing porcine molars and its posttranslational modification were characterized. Porcine Dsp has at least 6 N-linked glycosylations (Asn37, Asn77, Asn136, Asn155, Asn161, and Asn176) that average one sialic acid each, all in the form of N-acetylneuraminic acid. Porcine Dsp has exactly two glycosaminoglycan attachments (Ser238 and Ser250) that are comprised of chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate in a ratio of 7 to 3. Three O-linked glycosylations in Dsp were tentatively assigned (Thr200, Thr216, and Thr316). Glycosylations divide porcine Dsp into a heavily N-glycosylated, sialidated N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain with two GAG attachments, three O-glycosylations, and three potential phosphoserines. The two Dsp domains are separated by the lone cysteine (Cys190) that connects two Dsp chains into a covalent dimer. Knowledge of Dsp structure is an important starting point to understanding the how Dsp serves to initiate mineralization of dentin.

21291557|t|Extraction of proteins from dentin powder
21291557|a|

21291557|t|Maxillary and mandibular second molar tooth germs were extracted from 6 month old pigs and the soft tissue discarded. Enamel was removed by scraping with a curette and the remaining hard tissue was ground to a powder. All extraction steps were carried out at 4°C or on ice. The Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (1 mM AEBSF, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 50 μM bestatin, 15 μM E-64, 20 μM leupeptin, and 10 μM pepstatin) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were added into the buffer during the extraction. The extraction scheme is outlined in Figure 1. Forty grams of dentin powder (the amount obtained from 32 molars) was homogenized at 4°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl/4 M guanidine buffer (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was designated the first guanidine (G1) extract. The guanidine pellet was dialyzed against 4 L of 0.5 M acetic acid containing protease inhibitors until the tooth mineral has fully dissolved. The dialysis bag contents were centrifuged, and the supernatant was designated the acid (A) extract. The pellet was extracted with 0.5 M acetic acid/2 M NaCl and the supernatant was designated the acid salt (AN) extract. The AN pellet was extracted with 50 mM Tris-HCl/2 M NaCl buffer (pH 7.4) and the supernatant designated the Tris salt (TN) extract. The TN pellet was extracted with 50 mM Tris-HCl/4 M guanidine buffer (pH 7.4). Residual insoluble material (RIM) was pelleted by centrifugation. The guanidine supernatant was dialyzed against water. Following centrifugation, the pelleted material that had precipitated during dialysis was designated the second guanidine pellet (G2P), while the supernatant was designated the second guanidine extract (G2).

21291557|t|Purification of Dspp-derived proteins
21291557|a|

21291557|t|Western blot analyses using a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant porcine Dsp showed that low molecular weight (LMW) Dsp components were in the A extract, while high molecular weight (HMW) Dsp components were in the AN extract (Additional file 1). The AN and A extracts were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and the fraction containing Dsp positive material (based upon Western blot analyses) was further fractionated by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). For the AN extract, the HMW Dsp components were found in the first two chromatographic peaks (AN-S1 and AN-S2), which were combined and resolved into five fractions by RP-HPLC. The last three fractions to elute, designated ANS1/2-R3, ANS1/2-R4, and ANS1/2-R5, were comprised of successively larger stains-all positive smears of Dsp proteoglycan, respectively (Additional file 2). The LMW Dsp components in the A extract were found in the second (S2) of three fractions produced by size exclusion chromatography. S2 resolved into 14 fractions (designated a through n) on a POROS R2 column (4.6 mmID × 10 cm), equilibrated with 0.05% TFA and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient containing 0.05% TFA at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at room temperature. The LMW Dsp components were identified in fraction g (AS2R-g; Additional file 4).

21291557|t|To identify glycosylated peptides in porcine Dsp, the LMW and HMW Dsp components were digested with endoproteinase Glu-C or pronase and the glycopeptide products characterized. Endoproteinase Glu-C (Staphylococcus aureus Protease V8) is a serine proteinase that selectively cleaves peptide bonds C-terminal to acidic residues with a strong preference for glutamic over aspartic acid residues. Pronase is a cocktail of proteolytic enzymes that degrades all but short glycopeptides that are protected from cleavage by bulky carbohydrate chains.

21291557|a|

21291557|t|Fraction ANS1/2-R3, which produced a stains-all positive smear on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), was resolved into two parts (ANS1/S2-R3a and ANS1/S2-R3b) by RP-HPLC rechromatography (Additional file 2), lyophilized, and 200 μg of each part was resuspended in 40 mM Tris-HCl/40 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated with 0.2 units of chondroitinase ABC protease free (Associate of Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth, MA) at 37°C for 35 h. The digests resolved into six stains-all positive bands on SDS-PAGE, which were excised from the gel. Each gel slice was transferred to a DTube Dialyzer (midi size) (Novagen/EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) and the protein electroeluted with 25 mM Tris/250 mM Tricine/0.025% SDS buffer (pH 8.5) at 150 volts for 3 h. Each eluate was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, incubated in acetone overnight at -80°C and centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted, the pellet was dried under a hood, and was later characterized by Edman sequencing.

21291557|t|Purified ANS1/2-R3 (33 mg) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) was incubated with 0.2 mg of pronase at 37°C for 20 h. The digestion products were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex G-15 column (1.6 cm × 60 cm). The first eluted fraction of the pronase digest was positive for oligosaccharide or glycosaminoglycan chains using the phenol-sulphuric acid (PS) assay (Additional file 3) and was fractionated by RP-HPLC using a Discovery C18 column (10 mmID × 25 cm) equilibrated with 0.05% TFA and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient containing 0.05% TFA at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at room temperature. For the PS assay, aliquots from each Sephadex G-15 or Discovery C18 fraction were evaporated and 0.3 mL of water, 0.3 mL of 5% phenol, and 1.5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid were added. Measuring the absorbance at 490 nm on a spectrophotometer identified the peak containing oligosaccharides.

A labeled N-glycan standard (10 pmol; A2 glycan; QA-bio) and the 2-AA-glycosylations were separated by size exclusion-HPLC (SE-HPLC) using a Nanofilm-SEC 150 (7.8 mm × 30 cm) (Sepax Technologies Inc., Newark, DE) column equilibrated with PBS and was eluted with the same solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at the room temperature. The effluent was continuously monitored by a fluorescence monitor (FP-2020, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm (Additional file 5). The amount of released labeled glycosylations was determined by comparing the area under its chromatographic peak with the labeled A2 glycan standard.

21291557|t|For the qualitative analysis of sialic acid, each of the purified 2-AA glycosylation samples in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was incubated with 10 mU of sialidase Au (QA-bio) for 1 h at 37°C. An aliquot of the released sialic acid was labeled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxy-benzene (DMB) using a sialic acid labeling kit (QA-bio). The DMB-sialic acid samples were separated by RP-HPLC using a GlycoSep R (2.1 mm × 15 cm) (ProZyme Inc., Hayward, CA) column equilibrated with a mixture of acetonitrile-methanol-water (9:7:84, v/v) and eluted with the same solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at the room temperature. A fluorescence monitor using an excitation wavelength of 373 nm and an emission wavelength of 448 nm continuously monitored the effluent. The form of sialic acid in each sample was identified by comparing with retention times of a DMB-labeled sialic acid reference panel (QA-bio) (Additional file 5).

21291557|t|For the quantitative analysis of sialic acid we used the SialiQuant sialic acid quantitation kit (QA-bio). LMW Dsp (AS2R-g), HMW Dsp (ANS1/2-R5), and bovine fetuin (33.6 nmol) were digested with sialidase AU. These reactions, as well as 10 nmol of N-acetylneuraminic acid, were digested with N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase in Tris reaction buffer at 37°C for 30 min. A solution of β-NADH was added and the initial β-NADH absorbance was read at 340 nm (A340 initial). The reaction mixture was incubated with lactic dehydrogenase for 1 h at 37°C, then the final β-NADH absorbance was read (A340 final) and the nmoles of sialic acid calculated: nmoles of sialic acid = (A340 initial - A340 final) × 1000/6.22 (mM extinction coefficient of β-NADH is 6.22 at 340 nm) (Additional file 5). The result for the 10 nmol of N-acetylneuraminic acid was 8.68 nmol, so the results of other samples were corrected by multiplying by 1.15. For the bovine fetuin control this correction gave a result of 32.42 nmol.

21439076|a|

21439076|t|Thirty-five trials were included in the present analysis, with a total of 9,979 patients accrued. The analysis showed that the gemcitabine-based combination therapy was associated with significantly better overall survival (OS) (ORs, 1.15; p = 0.011), progression-free survival (PFS) (ORs, 1.27; p < 0.001), and overall response rate (ORR) (ORs, 1.58; p < 0.001) than gemcitabine monotherapy. Similar results were obtained when the gemcitabine-fluoropyrimidine combination was compared with gemcitabine, with the OS (ORs, 1.33; p = 0.007), PFS (ORs, 1.53; p < 0.001), and ORR (ORs 1.47, p = 0.03) being better in the case of the former. The OS (ORs, 1.33; p = 0.019), PFS (ORs, 1.38; p = 0.011), and one-year survival (ORs, 1.40; p = 0.04) achieved with the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination were significantly greater than those achieved with gemcitabine alone. However, no survival benefit (OS: ORs, 1.01, p = 0.93; PFS: ORs, 1.19, p = 0.17) was noted when the gemcitabine-cisplatin combination was compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. The combinations of gemcitabine and other cytotoxic agents also afforded disappointing results. Our analysis indicated that the ORR improved when patients were treated with the gemcitabine-camptothecin combination rather than gemcitabine alone (ORs, 2.03; p = 0.003); however, there were no differences in the OS (ORs, 1.03; p = 0.82) and PFS (ORs, 0.97; p = 0.78) in this case.

21439076|a|

21439076|t|Gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine or oxaliplatin was associated with enhanced OS and ORR as compared with gemcitabine in monotherapy, which are likely to become the preferred standard first-line treatment of LA/MPC.

21439076|t|Background
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fifth leading cause of death due to solid tumors in Western industrialized countries. Because pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often difficult to detect in early stages, most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease at first presentation. The median survival of patients with locally advanced disease is 6 to 10 months, compared to 3 to 6 months for patients with metastatic disease.
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Gemcitabine (Gemzar™; 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine) is a pyrimidine antimetabolite and a specific analogue of deoxycytidine. At present, gemcitabine monotherapy remains the standard care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LA/MPC). However, patients who receive this therapy have a median overall survival (OS) of only 5.65 months. In an effort to increase the objective response rate (RR) and survival of LA/MPC patients, many trials have been carried out in the last ten years to evaluate gemcitabine monotherapy or combination therapy regimens. Currently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines indicate that gemcitabine combined with one other agent is the optimal treatment for LA/MPC patients with evidence of category 2B disease (recommendation based on lower-level evidence).

21439076|t|It is unclear whether this regimen is the ideal treatment for LA/MPC or whether it should be reevaluated. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis to evaluate the available evidence from relevant randomized trials. This review will summarize the various trials of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens in LA/MPC and discuss how these results should affect clinical practice.

21439076|t|Search strategy
21439076|a|

21439076|t|We carried out a comprehensive search of the literature for randomized controlled trials in Pubmed using the terms "chemotherapy," "gemcitabine," "trials," and "pancreatic cancer" (no limitation for language). In addition to full publications, abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Cancer Conference (ECCO) were included.

21439076|t|Selection criteria
21439076|a|

21439076|t|To be eligible for inclusion, trials were required to be prospective, properly randomized and well designed, which we defined as matched for age, stage and performance status (PS) or Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease were included in the study, and histologic or cytologic confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was required.
21439076|a|

21439076|t|If a trial included concomitant interventions such as radiotherapy or radioisotope treatment that differed systematically between the investigated arms, the trial was excluded. Whenever we encountered reports pertaining to overlapping patient populations, we included only the report with longest follow-up (having the largest number of events) in the analysis. Only randomized trials were included, and randomization must have started on or after Jan 1, 1965. The deadline for eligible trial publication was July 30, 2010.
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Data collection
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Two reviewers (Jing Hu and Gang Zhao) assessed the identified abstracts. Both reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion according to prior agreement regarding the study population and intervention. Lei Tang and Ying-Chun Xu also cross-checked all data collected against the original articles. If one of the reviewers determined that an abstract was eligible, the full text of article was retrieved and reviewed in detail by all reviewers.
21439076|a|

21439076|t|For the 35 trials included in the meta-analysis, we gathered the authors' names, journal, year of publication, sample size (randomized and analyzed) per arm, performance status, regimens used, line of treatment, median age of patients and information pertaining to study design (whether the trial reported the mode of randomization, allocation concealment, description of withdrawals per arm and blinding).
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Statistical analysis
21439076|a|

21439076|t|The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager Version 4.2 (Nordic Cochran Centre, Copenhagen) and Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2 (Biostat™, Englewood, NJ). Heterogeneity between the trials was assessed to determine which model should be used. To assess statistical heterogeneity between studies, the Cochran Q test was performed with a predefined significance threshold of 0.05. Odds ratios (ORs) were the principal measurements of effect and were presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI). P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All reported p-values result from two-sided versions of the respective tests. The revision of funnel plots did not reveal any considerable publication bias.
21439076|a|

21439076|t|The primary outcome measurements were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS, time from randomization to progression or death), and secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR, number of partial and complete responses) and toxicity. Toxicities recorded by the original research group were recorded in our analysis, and the most frequent events were analyzed. In order to optimize our assessment of response, we used trials that included patients with measurable or assessable diseases and that were analyzed predominantly according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Toxicity profiles were reported according to the WHO criteria.

21439076|t|Selection of the trials
21439076|a|

21439076|t|The literature search uncovered 762 articles. Primary screening led to the exclusion of 390 articles for the following reasons: reviews (218), other agents/regimens (43), radiotherapy/chemoradiation (99), letters/comments/editorials or case reports. The remaining 372 papers were retrieved for more detailed evaluation. Of these, 144 articles were excluded because of adjuvant chemotherapy, 44 for biliary tract cancer, 110 for phase I clinical trials, 38 for not-controlled design and 2 for repeated reports. In the end, a total of 35 randomized clinical trials were eligible for inclusion in our analysis (Figure 1).

21439076|t|Characteristics of the trials included in the present analysis
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Thirty-five trials were included in the present analysis, with a total of 9, 979 patients accrued. Characteristics of the eligible trials are listed in Table 1. Most of the trials (34/35, 97%) evaluated gemcitabine-based chemotherapy for first line or palliative chemotherapy in LA/MPC patients, whereas one trial (Palmer 2007) evaluated neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-three trials compared single-agent gemcitabine with gemcitabine combined with other cytotoxic agents, nine trials studied gemcitabine monotherapy with gemcitabine plus targeted therapy, and three trials evaluated triplet therapy for LA/MPC patients.

21439076|t|This analysis evaluated 23 trials (5,577 patients) comparing single-agent gemcitabine with gemcitabine-based combinations with other cytotoxic agents. For the primary endpoint of OS, the gemcitabine-based combination therapy was associated with significantly better outcome (ORs, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.28; p = 0.011) than gemcitabine in monotherapy (Figure 2A). The analysis of PFS also afforded favorable results for the combination arm, with the ORs being 1.27 (95% CI, 1.14-1.42; p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). A similar advantage for gemcitabine-based combinations was observed in terms of the ORR (ORs, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31-1.91; p < 0.001), with no significant heterogeneity (p = 0.79).

Three trials used oxaliplatin (Louvet 2005, Poplin 2009, Yan 2007), and eight trials (Colucci 2010, Colucci 2002, Wang 2002, Heinemann 2006, Palmer 2007, Li 2004, Kulke 2009, Viret 2004) used cisplatin combined with gemcitabine. In these trials, the gemcitabine/platinum combinations prolonged OS in nine trials, whereas no survival benefit was seen in two trials (Colucci 2010, Wang X 2002).

However, the comparison of gemcitabine/cispiatin with gemcitabine alone showed that there was no survival benefit (OS: ORs, 1.01, p = 0.93; PFS: ORs, 1.19, p = 0.17) (Figure 3D, G). There was also a trend toward to increased ORR in the gemcitabine/cisplatin combination versus gemcitabine alone, with a pooled ORs of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.05). With regards to one-year survival, we did not find a difference between the gemcitabine/platinum group versus gemcitabine alone (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.44; p = 0.22) (Figure 4A), but there was a significant improvement in the gemcitabine/oxaliplatin group (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.93; p = 0.04) in the subgroup analysis (Figure 4B).

21439076|t|One trial (Palmer 2007) compared gemcitabine plus cisplatin with gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant setting. The study showed that the percentage of patients who underwent resection was 38% in gemcitabine arm versus 70% in the combination arm, with no increase in surgical complications. The 12-month survival percentages for the gemcitabine and combination groups were 42% and 62%, respectively. Combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin was associated with a higher resection rate and an encouraging survival rate, suggesting that further study is warranted.

21439076|t|The role of new, targeted drugs in the treatment of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been actively explored in the past few years. There are preliminary results and ongoing studies with EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, cetuximab), farnesyltransferase inhibitors (tipifarnib), leukotriene B4 receptor antagonists (LY293111), antiangiogenic agents (axitinib, cilengitide), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (marimastat), vascular endothelial growth factor A inhibitors (bevacizumab), and histone deacetylase inhibitors (CI-994).

Therefore, the addition of other targeted agents is not recommended for the treatment of LA/MPC in the current clinical setting outside of a clinical trials.

21439076|t|Two trials (Cascino 2008, Vervenne 2008) including 691 patients evaluated a gemcitabine doublet with or without a third targeted reagent. In Cascino's multicenter randomized phase II trial, the addition of cetuximab to the gemcitabine/cisplatin combination did not increase PFS (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI, 0.60-1.52, p = 0.847) or OS (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI, 0.54-1.55, p = 0.739). In 2008, Vervenne compared the efficacy and safety of adding bevacizumab to erlotinib and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The results showed that addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib and gemcitabine did not significantly prolong OS, but there was a significant improvement in PFS (p = 0.0002). This combination requires further investigation in larger-scale clinical trials to assess efficacy and cost effectiveness.

21439076|t|Discussion
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is among the most challenging of solid malignancies to treat on account of its propensity for late presentation with inoperable disease, aggressive tumor biology and resistance to chemotherapy. Gemcitabine monotherapy has become a cornerstone of therapy for patients with LA/MPC since Burris et al reported their phase III trial results. Although it has shown clinical benefit, gemcitabine monotherapy has been associated with limited antitumor activity, with an ORR of 5% and median OS of 5.7 months. In the past decade, many randomized controlled trials evaluated gemcitabine combined with various cytotoxic or targeted agents to try to improve outcomes for patients with LA/MPC. Some of these studies have reported improved median OS and one-year survival rates. However, the question of whether gemcitabine-based combinations are better than gemcitabine monotherapy is still unclear.

21439076|t|To compare the efficacy and tolerability of gemcitabine-based combinations in the treatment of LA/MPC with sufficient statistical power, we performed this meta-analysis to overcome the statistical limitations (for instance, low case load) of the individual trials and investigate treatment efficacy, safety profile and survival benefit of various therapeutic combinations.

21439076|t|The systematic review yielded five major findings. First, the analysis showed that gemcitabine-based combination was associated with significantly greater OS (ORs, 1.15; p = 0.011), PFS (ORs, 1.27; p < 0.001), and ORR (ORs, 1.58; p < 0.001) than gemcitabine monotherapy. The study reported by Heinemann revealed similar results; their study considered 15 trials including 4465 patients for the analysis of OS. The analysis revealed a significant survival benefit for gemcitabine+X (X = cytotoxic agent) with a pooled ORs of 0.91 (p = 0.004) and indicated that patients with a good PS had a marked survival benefit when receiving combination chemotherapy (ORs, 0.76; p < 0.0001).

21439076|t|A similar advantage for gemcitabine combined with fluoropyrimidine was observed in terms of the OS (ORs, 1.33; p = 0.007), PFS (ORs, 1.53; p < 0.001), and ORR (ORs 1.47, p = 0.03) as compared to gemcitabine alone. Although the occurrence of hematological toxicities, including neutropenia (ORs, 1.60; p = 0.002) and thrombocytopenia (ORs, 1.52; p = 0.04), was higher in the combination group, the incidence of anemia (ORs, 0.97; p = 0.90) and non-hematological toxicities such as nausea/vomiting (ORs, 1.10; p = 0.60) were similar in both groups.

21439076	195	206	gemcitabine	Chemical	MESH:C056507

21439076|t|It remained to be determined whether the combination of gemcitabine with 5-FU or that with capecitabine was better. Bolus 5-FU and high-dose leucovorin have not shown meaningful therapeutic benefits in phase II studies. However, researchers have speculated that continuous-infusion of 5-FU could improve its therapeutic efficacy. Capecitabine (N4-pentyloxycarbonyl-5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine) (Xeloda; F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), an oral tumor-selective fluoropyrimidine, has been reported to be as efficacious as continuous-infusion 5-FU. Capecitabine appears to be a reasonable substitute for infused 5-FU/LV in combination regimens or as monotherapy, with the added advantage of reducing the inconvenience of long infusion times. Cartwright reported that capecitabine alone has an ORR of 7.3% and a disease control rate of 24% in previously untreated patients with LA/MPC. In Cunningham's report, gemcitabine/capecitabine significantly improved ORR (19.1% v 12.4%; p = 0.034) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; p = 0.004) and was associated with a trend toward improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.02; p = 0.08) compared with gemcitabine alone. On the basis of these results, he recommended that gemcitabine/capecitabine should be considered one of the standard first-line options in LA/MPC.

21439076|t|In 1993, Wils was the first to report that single-agent cisplatin has therapeutic activity in LA/MPC with an ORR of 21%. Soon afterwards, several phase II studies discussed the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination in a variety of schedules. Adding cisplatin to gemcitabine appeared to be very active, with ORR ranging from 9% to 31% and median OS from 5.6 to 9.6 months in these phase II trials. Furthermore, in the neoadjuvant setting, Palmer (2007) showed that combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin was associated with a high resection rate and an encouraging survival rate.

21439076|t|However, the pooled analysis showed that the PFS and ORR achieved with the gemcitabine and platinum combination were significantly greater than those achieved with gemcitabine monotherapy; however, no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment approaches were observed in the case of OS. This result was consistent with that obtained in a study conducted by Bria. In Bria's meta-analysis, platinum combinations led to the greater absolute benefits in terms of PFS and ORR as compared with single-agent gemcitabine (10% and 6.5%, respectively), but did not result in an OS benefit. However, Heinemann reported contrary results, with a ORs of 0.85 (p = 0.010) for platinum-gemcitabine combinations compared to gemcitabine alone. Heinemann's study included 15 trials with 4465 patients, whereas Bria's study included 20 trials with 6296 patients; our study included 35 trials with 9979 patients. The greater number of included trials and case load in our study may have contributed to the more favorable results obtained in our study.

21439076|t|Further, our subgroup analysis showed that the OS (p = 0.019), PFS (p = 0.011), and one-year survival (p = 0.04) in the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin group were significantly better than those in the gemcitabine monotherapy group. On the contrary, the comparison of gemcitabine-cisplatin with gemcitabine alone showed that there was no survival benefit (OS: p = 0.93; PFS: p = 0.17) with the former. Hence, we concluded that the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin is superior to gemcitabine plus cisplatin and may be recommended as one of the standard first-line therapies for LA/MPC.

21439076|t|The third key finding was that the combination of gemcitabine plus other cytotoxic agents showed disappointing results. According to the literature, the combination of gemcitabine and irinotecan resulted in an objective response of 25% with a median OS ranging from 5.7 to 7 months (Rocha-Lima 2002, Stathopoulos 2004). Although our analysis found an enhanced ORR for gemcitabine plus camptothecin therapy (ORs, 2.03; p = 0.003), we did not find a significant difference in OS (ORs, 1.03; p = 0.82) or PFS (ORs, 0.97; p = 0.78) in the comparison. Other single agents including docetaxel and pemetrexed have also been tested in advanced pancreatic cancer. However, the analysis of two trials (n = 665) showed negative results. The OS in the combination group was even lower than that of patients receiving monotherapy (ORs, -0.10; p = 0.002), although the ORR analysis showed therapeutic benefit for this combination group (ORs, 1.91; p = 0.01).

21439076|t|Fourth, the identification of novel targets is still elusive for the treatment of LA/MPC. Since 2002, there has been a series of disappointing results. The only exception is erlotinib, which is the first and only targeted agent to demonstrate significantly improved survival in advanced pancreatic cancer when added to gemcitabine. Further research should be focused on new combinations or multi-target combined therapy, incorporating new, targeted therapies and identifying potential predictive factors of response.

21439076|t|The fifth finding concerned combining a gemcitabine doublet with or without a third targeted reagent. Our analysis revealed slightly better disease control by adding a third reagent to a gemcitabine doublet, with an ORs of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.00 to 2.62), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.05). The OS in the triplet group was also disappointing (ORs, -0.79; p < 0.00001). Vervenne's study showed that addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib and gemcitabine did not significantly prolong OS, but there was a significant improvement in PFS (p = 0.0002). This suggested that multi-target therapy may be a future direction for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. This combination should be further evaluated in larger clinical trials to assess its efficacy and cost effectiveness.

21439076|t|The present meta-analysis was not based on individual patient data and was not subjected to an open external-evaluation procedure. Therefore, the analysis is limited in that the use of published data may have led to an overestimation of the treatment effects. Although the risk of publication bias exists in any meta-analysis, we believe that this did not greatly affect our results because many positive and negative trials were included in the study.
21439076|a|

21439076|t|Moreover, some trials investigated gemcitabine-free combinations such as irinotecan/docetaxel or FOLFIRINOX for the treatment of LA/MPC. Among them, FOLFIRINOX (5-FU/leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) is an interesting and promising combination. At the 2007 ASCO annual meeting, Ychou reported that the use of FOLFIRINOX as the first-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer afforded a response rate of greater than 30% with manageable toxicity in ECOG 0-1 patients. In another study, Breysacher discussed the role of FOLFIRINOX as second-line therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. No response was seen in 13 patients, and the one-year survival rate was 62%. However, a large-scale randomized clinical trial is required to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX.

21439076|t|In the end, the goals of treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer should be to control tumor progression, alleviate disease-related symptoms and improve and maintain patients' quality of life (QOL). Reni reported on the effects of a gemcitabine combination versus monotherapy on patient QOL. The study showed that the largest differences between arms favored the gemcitabine combination group. Clinically relevant improvement in QOL from baseline was observed more often after combination therapy than after gemcitabine, suggesting that the combination regimen did not impair QOL.

The activation energy of the solid-state process was calculated using Flynn–Wall–Ozawa’s method without the knowledge of the reaction mechanism. The results indicated that thermal stability and the values of the calculated activation energies increased with the increase of the TEOS loading and the activation energy also varied with the percentage of weight loss for all compositions.

22606014|t|1. Introduction
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Polyimides are a type of organic polymers that have been widely used in many applications at high temperatures, such as in aerospace, microelectronic industries, semiconductor and composites. They demonstrate many advantages, which include excellent heat and chemical resistance, as well as outstanding combinations of thermal, mechanical and electrical insulating properties. Thermal property is one of the most important properties for polymeric materials. Many researchers have studied the polyimides properties, and most of them have reported excellent thermal stability for polyimides. Meng et al. (2007) have reported the thermal properties of a polyimide based on 2,6-bis(p-aminophenyl)-benzo[1,2-d;5,4-d]bisoxazole. The results showed excellent thermal stability, a 5% weight loss temperature (T5%) and glass transition temperatures (Tg) at 572 °C and 283 °C in N2 respectively. Meanwhile, thermal stability and thermal degradation kinetics are significant to production and application. In particular, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been widely employed to investigate thermal degradation kinetic and thermal stability of polymers. However, polyimides have many intrinsic weaknesses such as low thermal coefficient, poor corona-resistance property and comparatively high thermal expansivity, which can cause restrictions in some of their applications. For enhancement and to obtain the desired improvements of polyimides many research activities have been carried out through using a mixture of inorganic in polymer matrices. The sol-gel process is an important method for the preparation of these hybrid materials, whereby both organic and inorganic elements are mixed at a molecular level and the prepared intimate mixing provides various properties which are different from those of the traditional composites.

22606014|t|In the present study, polyimide/SiO2 composite films were prepared from poly(amic acid) (PAA) based on aromatic diamine (4-Aminophenyl sulfone) (4-APS) and aromatic dianhydride (3,3′,4,4′-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride) (BTDA) with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the SiO2 source via sol-gel process. The prepared composite films were characterized using by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermal degradation and kinetic parameters, such as activation energy of thermal degradation processes were also investigated through dynamic thermogravimetric analysis at different heating rates.

22606014|a|

22606014|t|The FTIR spectra of the prepared polyimide/SiO2 composite films, with different contents of silica, are depicted in Figure 1. The characteristic absorption bands of the imide groups near 1780, 1720 and 1378 cm−1 were observed in the FTIR spectra of the prepared samples after thermal imidization of the poly(amic acid)/SiO2 precursor. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption of the amide carbonyl at 1650 cm−1 did not appear in the spectra, indicating that the imidization reaction is complete. The characteristic vibration bands of Si–O–Si hydrolyzed from silica were also observed at 477 cm−1 and near 1100 cm−1. As the content of SiO2 particles increased, the intensity of Si–O–Si band gradually became stronger in the FTIR spectra of the polyimide/SiO2 composite films.

22606014|t|The prepared composite films were also characterized by XRD. Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of the polyimide/SiO2 composite films with various contents of SiO2, prepared according to processing conditions in Section 3.3. Figure 2b shows the XRD pattern of prepared SiO2 particles in the same conditions but in the absence PAA where the average size of obtained particles was 610 nm. As is clearly seen in Figure 2a, there is a peak in the diffractogram of the polyimide (curve I) as the non-Gaussian distribution pattern that reveals a semi-crystalline structure polymer. This peak was also depicted in the all diffractograms of polyimide composite films. As the loading of TEOS increased in the PAA precursor (curves II–IV), the peaks shoulder after 2θ = 16 also heightened, suggesting that this could be due to the formation of SiO2 particles and increase of SiO2 particles content in polyimide matrix.

22606014|t|The SEM photographs of the cross-section surfaces of polyimide/SiO2 composite films in various percentages of TEOS as SiO2 sources are shown in Figure 3. The created SiO2 particles which are in white globular shapes have dispersed into the polymer matrix uniformly. The average size of the SiO2 particles in the composite films were estimated to be around 265, 374, 580 nm for the prepared composite films with 10, 30, 50 wt% of TEOS loading respectively. The sizes of the SiO2 particles for the polyimide composite films with various percentages of TEOS loading are also compared in Table 1. On the basis of the morphological observations, with the increase of the TEOS loading, the SiO2 particles size were increased which can be seen from the increase in the aggregation leaning of the SiO2 particles. The SEM images also revealed that with the increase of the TEOS loading, the dispersion of the SiO2 particles in the hybrid also became more uniform. The adhesion of the silica particles with the polyimide matrix is low as the particles seemed to have been completely debonded from the surrounding polyimide matrix, indicating a very poor interfacial adhesion between the particles and the matrix. The comparison of the SEM images also indicated that in higher contents of TEOS loading, the interfacial adhesion decreased. As is clearly seen, the distribution and dispersion of the SiO2 particles within the polyimide matrix are relatively uniform and this factor can be effective on the thermal stability of composite films.

22606014|t|The thermal stability of the prepared polyimide/SiO2 composite films can be evaluated by TGA. The TG curves of the polyimide/SiO2 composite films with various SiO2 contents at heating rate of 5 °C/min are shown in Figure 4a. The TG curves indicate that water or solvent has been successfully eliminated from the polyimide film and also polyimide/SiO2 composite films because there is no weight loss below 100 °C. It can be clearly seen in Figure 4a that the residual weight of polyimide/SiO2 composite films after thermal decomposition is higher than polyimide film above 700 °C. The increase in the weight residues above 700 °C illustrates successful incorporation of higher amounts of silica into the polyimide/SiO2 composite films and ultimately increases in thermal stability. The temperatures of the thermal decomposition (Td) of the polyimide film and polyimide composite films are compared in Table 1. Results show that thermal decomposition of composite films increases with the increase of SiO2 contents leading to the assumption that the inorganic components, such as SiO2, can improve the thermal stability of organic materials. The improvement of the thermal stability of the prepared polyimide with SiO2 can be based on the fact that these materials have inherently good thermal stability and also due to the strong interaction/chemical bonding that exists between the polyimide and silica.

22606014|t|2.2.1. Theoretical Background
22606014|a|

22606014|t|One application of the thermogravimetric analysis is the determination of the kinetic parameters, such as reaction order, activation energy, etc. In the thermogravimetric analysis, the rate of reaction may be defined as the ratio of the actual weight loss to the total weight loss corresponding to the degradation process;
22606014|a|

22606014|t|where W0 is the initial weight of the sample, Wt is the actual weight of the sample, Wf is the final weight of the sample and X is the degree of decomposition.
22606014|a|

22606014|t|A typical model for a kinetic process can be represented by the decomposition rate (dX/dt) which is a function of temperature and weight of the sample. The decomposition rate can be expressed as:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|where dX/dt is the decomposition rate, k is the rate constant and f(X) is the differential expression of a kinetic model function. However, the rate constant k can be defined by the Arrhenius expression:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|A is the pre-exponential factor (s−1), E is the activation energy of the degradation reaction (kJ/mol), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and T is the absolute temperature (K). The combination of Equations (2) and (3) leads to the following equation:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|In the thermogravimetric analysis, the sample temperature can be changed with a constant heating rate β (β = dT/dt), whereby, whit the introduction of β, Equation (4) can be modified as follows:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Therefore, Equation (5) is a fundamental relation that determines the kinetic parameters on the basis of thermogravimetric data. Based on the degree of conversion measurement, X, and also the heating rate, β there are several methods available for the calculation of the apparent activation energy. Hence, the calculation of the kinetic parameters for the degradation from the thermogravimetric analysis data is strongly dependent on the method of calculation. There are a number of methods used to determine the apparent activation energy based on one or different heating rates of the TGA curves and these include Ozawa, Kissinger, van Krevelen, Coatse-Redfern, etc.. In the present study, the Ozawa’s method was employed to calculate the apparent activation energy of the thermal degradation of the polyimide (4-APS/BTDA) and polyimide (4-APS/BTDA)/SiO2 composite films.

22606014|t|2.2.2. Flynn–Wall–Ozawa Method
22606014|a|

22606014|t|The activation energy of the decomposition process can be calculated using the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa’s method without knowing reaction order and differential data of TGA. The integration of Equation (5) from an initial temperature T0, corresponding to a degree of conversion X0, to the peak temperature Tp, where X = Xp, gives:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|where g(X) is the integral function of conversion. Assuming x = E/RT, Equation (6) can be written as:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Ozawa’s method is based on Doyle’s approximation.
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Log p(x) ≈ 2.315 − 0.457x
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Or lnp(x) ≈ 5.330 − 1.052x
22606014|a|

22606014|t|For 20 < x < 60, Equation (7) can be written as:
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Here, A and R are constant and for a particular conversion, g(X) is a constant. Hence, the value of E can be computed by Ozawa’s method for any particular degree of decomposition, being determined from the linear dependence of log β versus 1/T plot at different heating rates without knowing of the reaction order.
22606014|a|

22606014|t|To determine apparent activation energy using Ozawa’s method, several TGA curves at different heating rates (β) are essential. Hence, the dynamic thermogravimetric analysis of polyimide and prepared composite films were performed at various heating rates, namely 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min in N2.

22606014|t|Figure 5 shows the thermal degradation curves of the polyimide and polyimide/SiO2 composite film with 50% of TEOS loading at different heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min. As depicted in the figure, the onset decomposition temperature increased with increase of the heating rates for both the compositions. The activation energy of the thermal degradation for pure polyimide and composite films were obtained using the Ozawa’s method, Equation (8), from a linear form a of log β versus 1000/T at a fixed conversion with the slope of such a line being −0.4567E/RT.

22606014|t|Figure 6 depicts the relationship between log β and 1000/T (K) for the different weight loss values. In this study, the chosen conversion values were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40% for polyimide and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 wt% for the polyimide/SiO2 composite films during the thermal degradation in nitrogen atmosphere. Similar observations were made for the nanocomposite films polyamide with 10 and 30 wt% TEOS loading according to Figure 6 which are not shown in the figures. The isoconversional plots are parallel straight lines that indicate a complex weight loss process with several mechanisms. The activation energies for every composition can be calculated from the slopes that correspond to the different conversions.

22606014|t|Figure 7 illustrates the values of the activation energies for the thermal degradation of the polyimide and the prepared polyimide/SiO2 composite films with different loading of TEOS versus percentage of weight loss in the nitrogen atmosphere. As depicted, the values of the activation energies vary with the percentages of weight loss for all compositions. From these curves, the mean activation energies of 258.7, 261.4, 266.5 and 272.4 kJ/mol were calculated for the polyimide pure and its composites with 10, 30 and 50 wt% of TEOS loading, respectively. The activation energies gradually increased with a smooth slope for the pure polyimide before 30% and this was before 25% of weight loss for the polyimide composite films, however, after these values, a jump in the activation energy was observed. This might be due to the residue formed during the thermal degradation. This jump in the polyimide composite films happened sooner; this could be due to the presence of SiO2 particles which had been homogeneously dispersed in the polyimide matrix. The dispersed SiO2 particles in structure of the prepared polyimide composite films can prevent the permeability of volatile decomposition product from the polyimide.

22606014	24	33	Polyimide	Chemical	MESH:C029945

22606014|t|As a representative procedure, the polyimide can be prepared through thermal imidization. For this purpose a solution of dianhydride monomer BTDA (0.483 g, 1.5 mmol) in NMP (3.0 g) was gradually added to a stirred solution of diamine monomer 4-APS (0.372 g, 1.5 mmol) in NMP (3.0 g) into a 50 mL round-bottomed flask that was equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The mixture was stirred at the room temperature for 24 h to allow viscosity to increase. The prepared PAA solution was subsequently cast onto a clean glass plate. The cast film was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 5 h and then heated at different temperatures and durations (125 °C for 2 h, 150 °C for 2 h, 180 °C for 1 h, 200 °C for 1 h, 250 °C for 1 h and 300 °C for 0.5 h) to convert the PAA into a uniform polyimide film and transparent in yellow color with thickness 90 μm. The temperature and time are both important factors in thermal imidization processing of poly(amic acid) components. In thermal imidization processing the imide ring is formed with elimination of H2O molecule from the amic acid and carboxylic acid groups in poly(amic acid) chains. The results showed that the elimination reaction is not relatively fast. Hence, it’s necessary selection of the appropriate combination of temperature and time in the thermal treatment experiments to gradual removal of solvent and formation of imide group rings.

22606014|t|Sol-gel process was employed in the synthesis of the polyimide/SiO2 composite films, as depicted in Figure 8. 0.372 g 4-APS was added to a round bottom flask and dissolved in NMP by stirring. An equimolar amount of BTDA (0.483 g) solution in NMP was then added to the prepared 4-APS solution. The mixture was stirred continually for 24 h, and finally, a mixture of TEOS and distilled water (4/1 based on TEOS molars) was added into prepared PAA solution 12 wt%. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was also added to maintain a pH of 4 and then, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h to yield a transparent solution. The sol-gel process in preparation of PAA was performed in two steps; namely the hydrolysis of alkoxides to produce the hydroxyl group, and residual alkoxides group to form a three-dimensional network. The obtained solution was cast on a clean glass plate and thermally treated in an oven, as explained Section 3.2. The polyimide/SiO2 composite films obtained in brownish color with thickness 90 μm.

The created SiO2 particles into polyimide matrix were investigated using X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, Model XRD 6000). The XRD patterns were recorded at a scan speed of 4 °C/min. The fracture surface morphology of the polyimide nanocomposite films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a LEO 1455 VPSEM. The fracture surfaces were sputter-coated with gold before viewing to eliminate electron charging effect. The particles size distribution was determined using the UTHSCSA image Tool Software (Version 3.00). The thermal properties were determined using the thermogravimetric analysis (Perkin-Elmer, Model TGA-7). Experiments were performed at different heating rate of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min in N2. The temperature range for TGA measurements were from 35 to 800 °C.

22606014|t|4. Conclusions
22606014|a|

22606014|t|Polyimide (4-APS/BTDA)/SiO2 composite films with various TEOS loadings were prepared by sol-gel process. Synthesis of polyimide (4-APS/BTDA) and formation of SiO2 particles were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The SEM microphotographs of the cross-section surfaces of polyimide/SiO2 composite films showed that the created white globular SiO2 particles were dispersed evenly in the polyimide matrix. On the basis of morphological observations, the average size of SiO2 particles increased with the increase of the TEOS loading. The TG curves of the polyimide/SiO2 composite films with various SiO2 contents showed that the thermal stability of the prepared polyimide composite films increased with increased SiO2 content. The thermogravimetric analysis results from the prepared polyimide composite films also illustrated the apparent activation energies of the thermal decomposition are gradually increased with increased SiO2 content. The dispersed SiO2 particles, in the structure of the prepared polyimide composite films, may be able to prevent the permeability of volatile decomposition products from the polyimide.

23173949|a|

23173949|t|Background
23173949|a|

23173949|t|As a typical Chinese herbal medicine, rhizoma Cimicifugae (RC, 升麻 in Chinese) possesses various pharmacological effects involved in antioxidant activity. However, its antioxidant activity has not been reported so far. The aim of the present study was to systematically evaluate the antioxidant ability of RC in vitro, then discuss the mechanism.
23173949|a|

23173949|t|Methods
23173949|a|

23173949|t|Firstly, five RC extracts (i.e. petroleum ether extract PERC, ethyl acetate extract EARC, absolute ethanol extract AERC, 95% ethanol extract 95ERC, and water extract WRC) were prepared and determined by various antioxidant methods, including anti-lipidperoxidation, protection against DNA damage, ·OH scavenging, ·O2- scavenging, DPPH· (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazl radical) scavenging, ABTS+· (2,2’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo- thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical ion) scavenging, Cu2+-chelating, and Fe3+ reducing assays. Subsequently, we measured the chemical contents of five RC extracts, including total phenolics, total saponins, total sugars, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid. Finally, we quantitatively analyzed the correlations between antioxidant levels (1/IC50 values) and chemical contents.

23173949|t|In the study, the antioxidant levels and chemical contents (including total phenolics, total saponins, total sugars, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid) of five RC extracts were determined by various methods. In all antioxidant assays, five RC extracts increased the antioxidant levels in a dose-dependent manner. However, their antioxidant levels (IC50 values) and chemical contents significantly differed from each other. Quantitative analysis of the correlation showed that total phenolic was of significant positive correlations (average R value was 0.56) with antioxidant levels; In contrast, total sugars and total saponins had no positive correlation with antioxidant (the average R values were −0.20 and −0.26, for total sugars and total saponins, respectively); Among total phenolics, three phenolic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid) also displayed positive correlations (the average R values were 0.51, 0.50, and 0.51, for caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, respectively).

23173949|t|Conclusions
23173949|a|

23173949|t|As an effective antioxidant, Rhizoma Cimicifugae can protect DNA and lipids against oxidative damage. Its antioxidant ability can be responsible for its various pharmacological effects and may be mainly attributed to the existence of total phenolics, among which caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid are regarded as main bioactive components. Rhizoma Cimicifugae exerts its antioxidant effect through metal-chelating, and radical-scavenging which is via donating hydrogen atom (H·) and donating electron (e).

23173949|t|Background
23173949|a|

23173949|t|As we know, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are various forms of activated oxygen including free radicals and non-free-radical species. ROS can oxidatively damage vital cellular structures such as lipids and DNA [1,2], then lead to severe biological consequences including mutation, cell death, carcinogenesis, and aging [3].

23173949|t|Therefore, it is important to search for potential therapeutic agents for oxidative damage. In recent years, medicinal plants especially Chinese medicinal herbals have attracted much attention.
23173949|a|

23173949|t|As a typical Chinese herbal medicine, rhizoma Cimicifugae (RC, 升麻 in Chinese, the photo is shown in Additional file 1) has been used for over 2000 years [4]. From the viewpoint of tradition Chinese medicine (TCM),RC can elevate yang, lift qi, clear heat, remove toxic, induce sweats to dispel exopathogens, and promote eruption [5].
23173949|a|

23173949|t|Modern medicine indicated that RC possessed various pharmacological effects. Ye reported that RC possessed antidepressant-like properties in rodents [6]; Kim pointed out that RC can treat pain and inflammation [7]; An isopropanolic extract of RC, however, was proved to be able to diminish the urinary content of PYR and DPY and the morphometric correlates of bone loss associated with ovariectomy in rats [8]; The supply of RC can therefore prevent OVX-induced bone loss in mice [9]. In addition, the extract of RC was found to have protective effect against gastric injury [10]. According to free radical biology & medicine [11], these pharmacological effects are related to antioxidant ability. However, its antioxidant ability has not been explored so far.

23173949|a|

23173949|t|As an important biomolecule, lipid can be easily attacked by ROS to generate lipid peroxidation which is harmful to cell. For example, the highly reactive ·OH radical can attack to lipid to produce lipidperoxidation (Equations 1–3):

23173949|t|In our study, five RC extracts increased the anti-lipidperoxidation percentages in a dose-dependent manner (Additional file 2). It means that five RC extracts can effectively protect lipid against oxidative damage. Among them, EARC possessed the highest anti-lipidperoxidation activity (Table  1).

23173949|t|Besides lipid, another biomolecule DNA can also be oxidatively damaged by ROS (especially ·OH). It is well known that DNA consists of deoxyribose, organic phosphate and various base pairs. When DNA is attacked by ·OH radical, MDA (malondialdehyde) and a number of oxidative lesions are generated [12]. MDA combines with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to produce thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) with λmax at 530 nm (Scheme  1).

23173949|t|Therefore, the A532nm value is proportional to the produced amount of ·OH radicals. Higher A532nm values indicate higher levels of ·OH radicals. If an antioxidant sample is added, the A532nm value will decrease, suggesting that some ·OH radicals are scavenged and the hydroxyl-induced DNA damage are protected by the antioxidant.

23173949|t|Previous studies have shown that there are two approaches for natural phenolic antioxidant to protect DNA oxidative damage: one is to scavenge the ·OH radicals then to reduce its attack; one is to fast repair the deoxynucleotide radical cations resulting from ·OH radicals attack [11]. In order to further confirm whether the protective effect against DNA oxidative damage was relevant to radical-scavenging ability, the ·OH and ·O2- radical-scavenging abilities of five RC extracts was determined in vitro.

23173949|t|As we know, ·OH radical in body is produced by Fenton reaction (Equation 4). However, our data suggested that five RC extracts can effectively scavenge ·OH radicals (Table  1 and Additional file 2).

23173949|t|Besides ·OH radical, superoxide anion radical (·O2-) is also regarded as one important form of ROS in living cell. It can directly attack DNA or lipid [13], and can transferred into ·OH via Haber-Weiss reaction (Equation 5) to indirectly damage DNA or lipid as well [2]. The results in Table  1 and Additional file 2 showed that five RC extracts could also scavenge ·O2- radicals.

23173949|t|Taken together, the protective effect of RC against hydroxyl-induced DNA oxidative damage can be assumed to be relevant to the ·OH or ·O2- radical-scavenging ability.

23173949|t|However, as illustrated in Equations 4 and 5, the generations of ·OH and ·O2- radicals rely usually on the catalysis of transition metals (especially Fe and Cu). So we further explored the metal chelating abilities of five RC extracts. The dose–response curves showed that five RC extracts possessed effective metal chelating abilities (Additional file 2). Our previous reports have shown that the chelating ability might be mainly attributed to ortho dihydroxyl groups in phenolic compounds [14]. For example, phenolic acids can bind Fe2+ as the following mechanism (Scheme  2) [15].

Caffeic acid, a phenolic acid occurring in RC, for example, could scavenge DPPH· via the proposed reaction (Scheme  3) [19].

23173949|t|Until now, about 200 compounds have been found in RC [21]. Generally, they belong to three different classes, i.e. phenolics, saponins, and polysaccharides. In the study, we used chemical method to measure the contents of total phenolics, total saponins, and total sugars in fiver RC extracts (Table  2). On the other hand, since 1/IC50 value showed parallelism with antioxidant level, it was therefore used to evaluate antioxidant level in the study (Additional file 2). On this basis, forty-eight correlation graphs were plotted to quantitative analyze the correlation between antioxidant levels and chemical contents in five RC extracts (Additional file 3). The correlation coefficients (R values) in Table  3 indicated that, total phenolics were of significant positive correlations (R = 0.17 ~ 0.99; average, 0.56) with antioxidant levels, while total sugars and total saponins had no positive correlations (for total sugars, R = −0.88 ~ 0.46, the average was −0.20; for total saponins, R = −0.92 ~ 0.94, the average was −0.26) with antioxidant levels. The data clearly demonstrated the significant contribution of phenolic compounds to the antioxidant of RC.

23173949|a|

23173949|t|As an effective antioxidant, rhizoma Cimicifugae can protect DNA and lipids against oxidative damage. Its antioxidant ability can be responsible for its various pharmacological effects and may be mainly attributed to the existence of total phenolics, among which caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid are regarded as main bioactive components. Rhizoma Cimicifugae exerts its antioxidant effect through metal-chelating, and radical-scavenging which is via donating hydrogen atom (H·) and donating electron (e).

23764261|t|Background
23764261|a|

23764261|t|Over the last two decades there has been rapid progress in synthetic organic chemistry associated with the search for new organic compound derivatives with desirable properties. Such compounds are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. Among the several FDA approved pharmaceutical drugs, the pyrazole core is found in rimonabant (1), and celecoxib (2) (Figure  1) [1].

23764261|t|Pyrazoles exhibit significant biological properties such as antihyperglycemic [2], analgesic [3], anti-inflammatory [4], antipyretic [5], antibacterial [6], hypoglycemic [7] and sedative-hypnotic activities [8].

23764261|t|The trifluoromethyl group is a very important substituent in medicinal chemistry, due to its unique stereoelectronic properties. A trifluoromethyl group usually increases the lipophilicity of a molecule, improving its transport characteristics in vivo. Furthermore, the strength and durability of the C-F bond compared with the С-Н bond (116 and 100 kcal/mol respectively) allows undesirable metabolic transformations to be avoided. So the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into bioactive molecules has become very important in pharmaceutical studies, stimulating work directed towards the elaboration of synthetic methodology for compounds containing trifluoromethyl groups. Because of all these factors, organofluorine chemistry has been vigorously developing during the past two decades [9].

23764261|t|Most of the known approaches to the synthesis of CF3-containing organic compounds suffer from serious drawbacks. First of all, the starting materials required for these methods are rather difficult to obtain, or they are fairly toxic and inconvenient to work with. Additionally, methods for direct fluorination and trifluoromethylation do not always allow the introduction of the CF3-group at the required position of a molecule.
23764261|a|

23764261|t|It is worth mentioning that most of the reported methods for synthesis of CF3-containing pyrazoles suffer from formation of mixures of regioisomers. Pavlik et al. studied the reactivity of CF3-enones towards N-substituted hydrazines where a mixture of regioisomers was obtained. Also, in the reaction of β-alkoxy substituted enones with N-methyl hydrazine two isomeric dihydropyrazoles were obtained [10,11]. Singh et al. investigated the reactivity of 3-(ethoxymethylene)1,1,1-trifluropentan-2,4-dione with various aryl and heteroaryle substituted hydrazines, and a mixure of pyrazoles formed [12].

23764261|t|Nenajdenko et al. obtained CF3-conatining pyrazoles with 100% regioselectivty from the reaction of α-bromo-ethoxy-trifluromethyl enone with aryl hydrazine, but with lower yield [13].

23764261|t|As a result the more flexible “synthon” approach, based on the application of simple and readily available fluorine-containing compounds has gained substantial interest [14]. Nitrilimines containing a fluro or trifluoromethyl moiety (liberated in situ from the corresponding hydrazonyl halide) are easily available compounds which can be prepared by various methods [15] and fairly convenient building blocks to prepare heterocyclic compounds containing a trifluoromethyl group.

23764261|t|It is evident from the recent literature that copper triflate [Cu(OTf)2] has invoked enormous interest as a green and potential Lewis acid catalyst to construct carbon–carbon and carbon– heteroatom bonds in various organic transformations [16-23]. Despite its great importance, only a few papers have reported on its catalytic application in organic synthesis [24].

23764261|t|Ultrasound irradiation has been utilized to accelerate a number of synthetically useful reactions during the last few years. Cavitation is the formation, growth and collapse of bubbles in an irradiated liquid. This effect induces very high local pressure and temperatures inside the bubbles and enhances mass transfer and turbulent flow in the liquid [25]. Ultrasound has been utilized to accelerate a number of synthetically useful reactions, especially in heterocyclic chemistry [26-36].
23764261|a|

23764261|t|As part of our ongoing interest in sonochemistry [37-42], and in a continuation of our interest in the synthesis of a wide range of heterocyclic systems for biological screening programme in our laboratory [43-51], we will introduce here a novel and efficient regioselective synthesis of trifluromethyl containing pyrazoles under ultrasonic irradaition promoted by catalytic amount of copper triflate and triethylamine.

23764261|t|It is clear from the results cited in Table  1, that only one isolable unique product was obtained (as examined by TLC). The best yield of 90% of the isolated product was reached using Cu(OTf)2 and Et3N, each of 0.05 equiv. (entry 7). The reaction gave relatively low yield when 0.05 or 0.1 equiv. of Et3N alone was used (entry 3,4). Furthermore, sodium ethoxide base gave a trace amount of product (entry 2) and no reaction was observed in the absence of catalyst or using Cu(OTf)2 as catalyst in 5 or 10 mol% (entry 1,5,6 respectively). Also from Table  1, the effect of loading (Mol%) on the% yield of isolated product was studied, and it is clear that 0.05:0.05 equiv. of Cu(OTf)2 and Et3N furnishes the respective product in a quantitative yield (Table  1, entry 7,8).

23764261|t|It is worth mentioning that we followed the above reaction to completion using GC-MS and the resulting products were identified from their retention times. It was found that 100% regioselectivity was attained in presence of Cu(OTf)2 with Et3N (Table  1, entry 7 and 8) but in the presence Et3N only (Table  1, entry 3 and 4) there was a very small amount (traces) of other product detected by GC-MS, which completely disappeared in recrystalization of the crude product to give only pure 5a.

23764261|t|The isolated product was identified as the pyrazole structure 5a, although two regioisomeric cycloadducts 5a and 6a seemed possible (Scheme  1). Unambiguous structure determination of the obtained products is therefore crucial to rationalize the observed regioselectivity. Structure elucidation was conveniently achieved on the basis of the 1H-13C connectivities (gHMBC) showed by methyl protons towards the carbonyl group and C-4 of pyrazole. On this basis, the analysis of gHMBC spectra of the product led us to attribute the signal at δ 191.65 ppm to the quaternary carbon (carbonyl group) owing to its correlation peaks with the methyl protons at δ 2.65 ppm; also, the signal at δ 112.11 ppm to the C-4 of the pyrazole owing to its correlation peaks with the methyl protons at δ 2.65 ppm. This observation indicated that the methyl protons correlate to carbonyl functional group and the C-4 of the pyrazole, which is in accordance to the structure 5a (Figure  2). Therefore, 1H-13C HMBC of the product formed provides sharp evidence for the existence of regioisomer 5a and rules out the other alternative structure 6a. Consequently the reaction product was identified as the pyrazole structure 5a (Scheme  1).

23764261|t|The formation of pyrazole product 5a is in line with the well established earlier studies for β-diketones containing highly fluorinated groups, in which the enolic content predominates, as in Figure  3[52-54].

23764261|a|

23764261|t|It is reasonable to propose a mechanism for formation of the pyrazole 5a under the adopted reaction conditions (Scheme  2). Pyrazole 5a was assumed to form via nitrile imine 7 (liberated in situ from 3 by the action of triethylamine and release triethyl ammonium salt) which involved a more or less concerted cycloaddition reaction. In the Cu(OTf)2-catalyzed addition reactions it reacts with the enolized form of β-diketone 4aII to generate copper(II) intermediate 8 and release of triflic acid (TfOH). The nitilie imine 7 reacts with intermediate 8 to give non isolable intermediate 5-hydroxy-2-pyrazoline derivative 9, and cyclizes via elimination of molecule of water to yield the desired regioselective pyrazole derivatives 5a.

23764261|t|Also, to find the specific effect of ultrasound on these reactions, all previously mentioned reactions were carried out under the same conditions in the absence of ultrasound irradiation (Table  2). It was observed that the reaction time increased considerably and the yield of the products decreased. Thus, ultrasound was found to have a beneficial effect on the synthesis of pyrazole derivatives, in which the time of the above reactions decreased from 8 to 10 h in the conventional procedure to less than 1 h. Also, there was an improvement in the yields of the reactions under ultrasonic irradiations.

23764261	13	21	pyrazole	Chemical	MESH:C031280

23764261|t|The structure of pyrazole derivatives 11a–l was assigned on the basis of their elemental analyses and spectral data. For example, the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 11a revealed two singlet signals at δ 2.29 and 2.74 due to the two methyl groups in addition to aromatic multiplet at δ 7.31–7.71. The mass spectrum of the same compound revealed a peak corresponding to its molecular ion at m/z 296. The mechanism of the formation of compounds 11a-l is in line with those depicted in Scheme  2.

23764261|t|From the data cited in Table  3, it was observed that the reaction time increased considerably and the yield of the products decreased under conventional method. Thus, ultrasound was found to have beneficial effect on the synthesis of pyrazole derivatives in which decrease time of above reactions from 7 to 11 h in conventional procedure to 45 min. to 1 h. Also, there was a noticeable improvement in the yields of the reactions under ultrasonic irradiations.

23764261|t|The improvement induced by ultrasound in the above mentioned reactions can be attributed to the well established theory for the cavitation, The collapse of bubbles caused by cavitation produces intense local heating and high pressures [55,56], so reaction time decreases clearly and high% yield was obtained.

23764261|t|Conclusion
23764261|a|

23764261|t|An ultrasonic assisted efficient protocol for the regioselective synthesis a series of novel pyrazoles containing the trifluromthyl moiety utilizing an efficient catalytic system Cu(OTf)2/Et3N was reported. Cu(OTf)2/Et3N catalyst showed a great advantage over all the investigated catalysts and ultrasonic irradiation method offered high yields of pyrazoles in short reaction times compared with classical conditions. gHMBC spectra of the product were used to rationalize the observed regioselectivity.

Tables  1, 2, 3). All The reactions were kept at 70–80°C (the temperature inside reaction vessel was 70–76°C and the reaction flask was put in the mid of sonicator bath to to achieve effective cavitations). The sonochemical reactions were continued until the starting materials were no longer detectable by TLC. After the completion of the reaction, EtOAc (30 mL) was added to dilute the reaction solution. Then, the mixture was washed with water. The combined organic phases were dried and concentrated in vacuo, and the remaining residue was purified by recrystalization from ethanol to afford pyrazole derivatives 5a,b and 11a-j. The above reaction was studied also by using various condition and catalysts.

23936010|t|Recent studies have proposed that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have direct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vascular tissue, explaining their cardioprotective effects. However, the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We tested whether n-3 PUFAs showed antioxidant activity through the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master transcriptional factor for antioxidant genes. C57BL/6 or Nrf2−/− mice were fed a fish-oil diet for 3 weeks. Fish-oil diet significantly increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the aorta of C57BL/6 mice, but not in the Nrf2−/− mice. Furthermore, we observed that 4-hydroxy hexenal (4-HHE), an end-product of n-3 PUFA peroxidation, was significantly increased in the aorta of C57BL/6 mice, accompanied by intra-aortic predominant increase in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rather than that in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with DHA or EPA. We found that DHA, but not EPA, markedly increased intracellular 4-HHE, and nuclear expression and DNA binding of Nrf2. Both DHA and 4-HHE also increased the expressions of Nrf2 target genes including HO-1, and the siRNA of Nrf2 abolished these effects. Furthermore, DHA prevented oxidant-induced cellular damage or reactive oxygen species production, and these effects were disappeared by an HO-1 inhibitor or the siRNA of Nrf2. Thus, we found protective effects of DHA through Nrf2 activation in vascular tissue, accompanied by intra-vascular increases in 4-HHE, which may explain the mechanism of the cardioprotective effects of DHA.

23936010|t|Introduction
23936010|a|

23936010|t|N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) in fish oil were shown to reduce cardiovascular disease in epidemiological studies of Eskimo during the 1970s , . More recent large-scale interventions and cross-sectional studies have shown that n-3 PUFAs reduce cardiovascular events independently of the classical risk factors for atherosclerosis –, which suggests direct anti-atherogenic effects of n-3 PUFAs on vascular tissues. Many studies have already demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs display a variety of bioactive actions such as anti-inflammatory ,  and antioxidant effects , , improvement of endothelial function ,  and a suppressive effect on monocyte adhesion in vascular tissue , ,  explaining the anti-atherogenic effects of n-3 PUFA. In a recent study, enzymatic metabolites from n-3 PUFAs, including resolvins and protectins, were reported to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in aortic endothelial cells, leading to atheroprotective effects . It has also been suggested that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) by n-3 PUFAs in vascular endothelial cells plays an important role in the atheroprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs , . A more recent study has shown that DHA suppresses NFκB activation through G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) in macrophages . However, the critical mechanism explaining the cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs remains a matter of debate.

23936010|t|Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive master regulatory transcriptional factor, and plays an important role in maintaining the atheroprotective capacity of vascular endothelial cells by regulating endothelial redox balance –. In unstimulated cells, Nrf2 resides in the cytoplasm bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Electrophiles, shear stress or reactive oxygen species (ROS) instigate modification of the cysteine residues of Keap1, which allows translocation to the nucleus and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) consensus sequence, resulting in the transcription of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase (GCL), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) –. HO-1 in particular, a rate-limiting enzyme in heme metabolism, has been recognized as an important factor protecting vascular tissue against atherosclerosis by exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-apoptotic and vasodilatory effects on the vasculature .

23936010|t|A recent study reported that a fish-oil diet induced HO-1 expression in the kidney of obstructive renal injury rats . DHA has also been shown to increase HO-1 expression in a Nrf2-dependent manner in EA.hy926 cells . Furthermore, it has been reported that the suppressive effects of n-3 PUFAs such as EPA and DHA on the LPS-induced inflammatory response were absent in peritoneal macrophages isolated from Nrf2 null mice , and further studies have proposed that J3 and D4 isoprostanes (as oxidation products of n-3 PUFAs) activate Nrf2 in HepG2 and porcine pulmonary endothelial cells, respectively , . However, it is uncertain whether intake of a fish-oil diet activates Nrf2 in vascular tissue, resulting in the vasculoprotective effect.

23936010|t|In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that fish-oil diet increases antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1, an important atheroprotective factor, and the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response, through the activation of Nrf2 in vascular tissue. We also investigated whether fish-oil diet increases the intra-vascular concentrations of the peroxidation end-product of n-3 PUFAs to discuss the biological mechanisms on the vasculoprotective effects. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms of EPA and DHA on Nrf2-mediated induction of antioxidant enzymes including HO-1 and the consequent antioxidant effect in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

23936010|t|All animal experiments were approved by the Shiga University of Medical Science Committee on Animal Research (Permit Number: 2009-11-3). Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. C57BL/6 background Nrf2−/− mice have been previously described . A Fish oil (#112246) or soy oil-based control diet (#110700, AIN-93 G, Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA) was fed to each mouse. Table 1 shows the detailed composition of each experimental diet. Table 2 also shows fatty acid composition of dietary fats used for the experimental diets. Mice were euthanized by isoflurane overdose after 3 weeks of diet, following an overnight fast, to analyze the effect of each diet on mRNA or protein expression of HO-1 in thoracic aorta.

23936010|t|C57BL/6 and Nrf2−/− mice were euthanized by 160 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium salt after 3 weeks of diet, following an overnight fast, to analyze the effect of each diet on the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response in the thoracic aorta. The thoracic aorta was isolated and cut into rings with special care to reserve the endothelium. The rings, under a resting tension of 1.0 g, were exposed to 30 mM KCl; this contraction was defined as 100% for subsequent analysis of contraction in response to agonists. Responses to cumulative concentrations of L-phenylephrine (10−7 to 10−6 M) were then obtained. Relaxant responses to ACh (10−9 to 10−7 M) or SNP (10−9 to 10−6 M) were obtained in the rings pre-contracted with L-phenylephrine to construct concentration-response curves. At the end of each experiment, 10−4 M papaverine was added to induce the maximal relaxation, which was taken as 100% for comparison with relaxation induced by agonists.

23936010|t|Intra-aortic 4-HHE and 4-HNE were quantitatively analyzed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Thoracic aortas were fractured in liquid nitrogen using a Cryo Press (Microtec Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) and subjected to lipid extraction. The samples solubilized in 490 µL chloroform/methanol (1∶1, v/v) and 10 µL BHT solution (10 mg/mL in ethanol) were incubated at 36°C for 1 h. Total 4-HHE and 4-HNE levels were quantitatively measured as previously reported . Briefly, [2H3]-4-HNE (Cayman) as internal solution was spiked to 200 µL samples obtained from lipid extraction. Then, samples were passed through using a mix-mode anion exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, Oasis MAX (Waters, Milford, MA). After extraction, the eluate was spiked with BHT solution and acidified cyclohexanedione (CHD) reagent was added to derivatize 4-HHE or 4-HNE. CHD-derivatization was carried out at 60°C for 1 h, and derivatized 4-HHE or 4-HNE was then extracted using a SPE cartridge, Oasis HLB (Waters). The eluate from SPE was injected into a LC-MS/MS system. LC was performed using an ACQUITY UPLC (Waters), and an API4000 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) was used as a detector. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed-phase column, ACQUITY CSH C18 (Waters), with two mobile phases and electrospray ionization in positive ionization with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used to analyze derivatized 4-HHE and 4-HNE. 4-HHE or 4-HNE levels were normalized to the weight of tissue.

23936010|t|Nrf2-mediated Effects of Fish-oil Diet in Aorta
23936010|a|

23936010|t|To investigate the Nrf2-mediated effects of a fish-oil diet in vascular tissue, we examined expression of the HO-1 gene. The fish-oil diet-fed groups showed a smaller increase in body weight compared with the control diet-fed group, but there was no difference between C57BL/6 and Nrf2−/− mice (Table 3). Plasma triglyceride was significantly increased in both the Nrf2−/− groups, but there were no significant differences in plasma glucose, total cholesterol or non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) among the four groups (Table 4). Fig. 1A shows the effects of a fish-oil diet on HO-1 mRNA expression in thoracic aorta tissue of C57BL/6 or Nrf2−/− mice. The fish-oil diet significantly increased mRNA expression of HO-1 in C57BL/6 mice, while the increase was not observed in Nrf2−/− mice. The increase in HO-1 protein expression by fish-oil diet was similarly absent in the Nrf2−/− mice as shown in Fig. 1B. Next, we examined whether the fish-oil diet altered ACh-dependent vasorelaxation in the aorta. The fish-oil diet significantly increased the ACh-dependent vasodilatory response compared with control diet in wild type mice. In contrast, there was no effect of the fish-oil diet in Nrf2−/− mice (Fig. 1C and 1D). The effects of fish-oil diet on SNP-dependent vasorelaxation were also investigated. Fish-oil diet had no effect on SNP-dependent response (Fig. 1E and 1F). Thus, the data indicate that a fish-oil diet increases the Nrf2-mediated vasodilatory response in an endothelium-dependent manner.

In contrast, EPA did not affect the intracellular levels of 4-HHE or 4-HNE. The stock solution of BSA-conjugated DHA used for the experiment was confirmed to be free of 4-HHE, suggesting that the production of these peroxidation products occurred in the cells (data not shown).

Under these conditions, the effect of DHA was abolished by treatment with 5 µM ZnPP (Fig. 6A). In addition, HUVECs treated with the siRNA targeted against Nrf2 were exposed to tBHP (250 or 500 µM) after treatment with DHA for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 6B and 6D, pretreatment of DHA significantly suppressed tBHP-induced cell toxicity or ROS production in the cells treated with control siRNA, but these effects of DHA were disappeared in the cells treated with the siRNA for Nrf2. Furthermore, 4-HHE showed similar Nrf2-mediated effects of DHA (Fig. 6C), suggesting that 4-HHE derived from DHA protected cells from oxidative stress through Nrf2-HO-1 signaling.

However, DHA-induced expression of HO-1 mRNA was not reduced in the PPARα knockdown HUVECs (Fig. 7B). Second, HUVECs were treated with several cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors or antioxidants, and DHA-induced expression of HO-1 mRNA was examined. As shown in Fig. 7C–E, inhibitors of COX1 or COX2, as well as radical scavengers such as BHT and α-tocopherol, did not reduce DHA-induced expression of HO-1 mRNA. In contrast, NAC, which is the most bioavailable precursor of glutathione, significantly reduced the expression of HO-1 mRNA induced by DHA or 4-HHE (as shown in Fig. 7F).

23936010|t|Discussion
23936010|a|

23936010|t|Recent studies have shown that dietary fish oil can increase Nrf2 target genes including HO-1 in the heart or kidney , . It has also been reported that the suppressive effects of EPA and DHA on LPS-induced expression of inflammatory molecules in isolated peritoneal macrophages were not observed in macrophages isolated from Nrf2−/− mice . Furthermore, more recent study has demonstrated that DHA activates Nrf2-HO-1 pathway, resulting in inhibition of NFκB-mediated endothelial inflammation . Although these studies suggest that n-3 PUFAs might have Nrf2-mediated atheroprotective activities, Nrf2-dependent increases in antioxidant activity and vascular endothelial function by n-3 PUFAs have not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that a fish-oil diet induced the antioxidant adaptive gene HO-1 in aortic tissue, and enhanced vasodilatory responses in an endothelium-dependent manner through the Nrf2 signaling pathway. This study is the first to show the Nrf2-mediated increase in endothelial function by fish oil in vivo.

23936010|t|We also showed that dietary fish-oil supplementation increases intra-aortic concentration of 4-HHE as an end-product aldehyde of n-3 PUFAs peroxidation, accompanied by intra-aortic predominant increase in DHA rather than that in EPA. In addition, we observed that DHA, but not EPA, causes an increase in intracellular 4-HHE in cultured vascular endothelial cells. Next, we demonstrated that DHA, but not EPA, induces antioxidant enzymes including HO-1 through the activation of Nrf2, resulting in increased antioxidant activity. The present study has also shown that 4-HHE induces HO-1 expression through Nrf2 activation (as reported in our previous study ), and increases Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity as shown in Fig. 6C. It has already been reported that plasma levels of 4-HHE were elevated following supplementation with 800 or 1600 mg/day DHA . Furthermore, protein adducts of 4-HHE have been shown to increase in heart or liver of animals fed an n-3 PUFA-rich diet , . Thus, we speculated that 4-HHE derived from DHA might contribute to the vasculoprotective effect of n-3 PUFAs (Fig. 8).

23936010|t|We observed that DHA-induced HO-1 mRNA expression was dramatically reduced by treatment with NAC, probably because cysteine residues in NAC binds to 4-HHE, leading to protection of the cysteine residues in Keap1, a major regulator of Nrf2 protein degradation. We have also shown that BHT or α-tocopherol, as antioxidants, did not affect the DHA-induced mRNA expression of HO-1, suggesting a role of increased intra-vascular 4-HHE by DHA in Nrf2-mediated antioxidant abilities. This is also supported by a recent study showing that 4-HNE, a lipid peroxidation product of n-6 PUFAs, can directly modify cysteine residues on Keap1, leading to activation of Nrf2 . In contrast, recent studies have proposed the participation of the COX- or lipoxygenase-mediated metabolites of n-3 PUFAs, or PPARs and GPR120 in the cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs , , . Thus, we investigated whether previously reported mechanisms of DHA are responsible for Nrf2-mediated expression of HO-1. However, our results showed that COX or PPARα was of little relevance to DHA-induced HO-1 mRNA expression. We also observed no expression of GPR120 in HUVECs (data not shown). Thus, we speculated that intra-vascular 4-HHE produced from DHA may directly stimulate Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and contribute to the cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs. 4-HHE has been considered to be a toxic lipid peroxidation product similar to 4-HNE, a peroxidation product of n-6 PUFAs . However, a recent study has shown that intravenous administration of 4-HNE protected against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice via the Nrf2-dependent pathway . Therefore, it is plausible that lower concentrations of intra-vascular 4-HHE associated with the intake of DHA may have a beneficial effect through the preconditioning effect of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling.

23936010|t|A large scale intervention trial for Japanese with hyper-cholesterolemia has shown that purified EPA can significantly reduce total coronary events in a group with a previous history of such events, despite less of an effect on Nrf2 activation than seen in our study . This implies that mechanisms other than Nrf2 activation contribute to the cardioprotective effects of fish oil-derived n-3 PUFAs. However, recent studies have proposed different beneficial effects between DHA and EPA on cardiovascular risk factors. Sekikawa et al. have reported that, in contrast to EPA, serum DHA levels show a significant inverse correlation to intima-media thickness (IMT) in men aged 40 to 49 years in Japan and the United States . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in overweight, mildly hyperlipidemic men, DHA, but not EPA, enhances vasodilatory responses compared with olive oil in the microcirculation of the forearm, although this is predominantly due to endothelial-independent mechanisms . Therefore, it can be considered that Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity of DHA might contribute to clinical cardioprotective effects in a manner different to that of EPA.

23936010|t|Recent studies have demonstrated that HO-1 plays an important role in preventing atherogenesis in vivo –. In the present study, we demonstrated that dietary fish oil induced HO-1 in a manner that was Nrf2-dependent. The antioxidant effects of DHA, as assessed by tBHP-induced LDH leakage in HUVECs, were obviously decreased by treatment of ZnPP, a HO-1 inhibitor, suggesting that Nrf2-HO-1 signaling is a critical factor for the antioxidant effects of DHA. We have already reported that vascular oxidative stress increased by insulin resistance causes decreased tetrahydrobiopterin and increased NADPH oxidase activity, resulting in decreased endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation , . In fact, endothelial-specific increases in HO-1 expression have been shown to restore the angiotensin II-induced reduction in ACh-dependent vasorelaxation accompanied by an increase in eNOS phosphorylation . It has also been reported that HO-1 induction by cobalt protoporphyrin, a HO-1 inducer, restores high-blood-flow-dependent remodeling and endothelial function in mesenteric arteries of old rats . Therefore, HO-1-mediated reduction in oxidative stress might contribute to the Nrf2-dependent vasodilatory response induced by fish-oil diet in the present study.

23936010|t|In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that a fish-oil diet increased HO-1 expression and the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response through the activation of Nrf2. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that DHA, but not EPA, is able to increase antioxidant activity through Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression in conjunction with increased intra-vascular 4-HHE. Therefore, the present study provides a possible novel explanation for the cardioprotective effects of DHA.

24066043|t|A novel flavoprotein monooxygenase, trans-anethole oxygenase (TAO), from Pseudomonas putida JYR-1, which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of trans-anethole to p-anisaldehyde, was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified. Enzymatic kinetics of diverse substrates and cofactors revealed that TAO is likely to be a novel self-sufficient flavoprotein monooxygenase. Enzyme assays of GST-TAO demonstrated that TAO catalyzed a trans-anethole oxidation reaction without auxiliary component enzyme-like electron-transfer flavin reductases. The single component TAO had the ability to reduce flavin cofactors and simultaneously oxidize trans-anthole to p-anisaldehyde. In the processes of reduction of flavin and oxidation of trans-anethole, TAO accepted various flavin and NAD(P)H cofactors. TAO also catalyzed oxidation of isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole, all of which contain the 2-propenyl functional group on the aromatic ring structure with different catalytic efficiency. TAO had the greatest catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) with the original substrate, trans-anethole. Investigation about partially deleted mutants of TAO indicated that reductase active sites appeared to be located near the N terminal. Site directed mutagenesis studies also proved that the proposed flavin binding sites, Trp-38, Thr-43, Tyr-55, were critical for flavin reduction. However, disruption of any portion of TAO eliminated the oxygenase activity.

24066043|t|Introduction
24066043|a|

24066043|t|Bacterial oxygenases are important biological catalysts incorporating one or two oxygen atoms into organic compounds, which is often very difficult to perform via chemical reactions . The oxygenases activate and functionalize molecular oxygen by using a reduced metal or organic cofactor through electron-transfer partners, such as iron-sulfur proteins and flavin reductases. Generally, reducing equivalents are supplied by NADH or NADPH as electron donors . For example, flavoprotein monooxygenases uses a purely organic cofactor, flavin, for oxygenation reactions and utilize a general mechanisms whereby NAD(P)H reduces the flavin, and the reduced flavin reacts with O2 to form a C4a-(hydro) peroxyflavin intermediate, which is the oxygenation agent . The oxygenation reactions catalyzed by the flavoprotein monooxygenases include hydroxylations, epoxidations, halogenations, Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, sulfoxidations, and oxidations of amines, selenide, phosphate esters and organoboron .

24066043|t|While the flavoprotein monooxygenases are classified into six groups based on sequence and structural data , they can also be divideded into two major classes: single-component (or self-sufficient flavoprotein monooxygenase) and a two-component enzymes composed of a reductase and an oxygenase. Hydroxylation and Baeyer-Villiger type oxidation reactions have been known to be catalyzed by either single-component or two-component flavoprotein monooxygenases –. However, an epoxidation reaction, which is a well known process in styrene metabolism, is catalyzed by mostly two-component flavoprotein monooxygenases –. It should be noted that the self-sufficient enzymes appear to have enhanced catalytic efficiency compared to the separated multi-component enzymes, which physically separate the oxygenase and reductase components. It has been postulated that the closer location between the oxygenase and reductase components in the self-sufficient enzymes results in a reduction in auto-oxidation caused by reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, between the two components , . This subsequently results in an increased diffusion of the reduced FAD in the interprotein transfer process. Moreover, as expected, the self-sufficient oxygenases are better than the multi-component enzyme systems in terms of practical applications for purifying and immobilizing the enzymes in cell-free systems. For this reason, efforts have been devoted to find novel self-sufficient enzymes  or create artificial self-sufficient chimeric proteins  that have versatile activities with diverse substrates.

24066043|t|We previously reported ,  the isolation of the tao gene from Pseudomonas putida JYR-1 encoding trans-anethole oxygenase (TAO) activity. The enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of trans-anethole, a type of phenylpropanoid compound formed via terpene biosynthesis in plants , to p-anisaldehyde. Interestingly, whole cell assays done with TAO heterologously expressed in E. coli showed that the enzyme also acted on isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole as substrates, all of which contain the propenyl functional group on the aromatic ring structure . Compared to the extremely narrow substrate range of isoeugenol monooxygenases, Iem, from Pseudomonas nitroreducens Jin1 , and Iso from Pseudomonas putida IE27 , that only use isoeugenol as a substrate, TAO exhibited a relatively broad substrate range. TAO is likely to be NAD(P)H-dependent, even though there was no conserved NAD(P)H binding domain found from the deduced amino acid sequence . Since the TAO from Pseudomonas putida JYR-1 displayed very low similarity to the deduced amino acid sequences of other enzymes in currently available databases, it was thought to be a novel enzyme, worthy of further characterization. In the present study, TAO tagged with glutathione S-transferase was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified. Enzymatic kinetics of GST-TAO was investigated using diverse substrates and cofactors. Results of these studies indicated that TAO is likely a novel self-sufficient flavoprotein monooxygenase.

24066043|t|The full length TAO from P. putida JYR-1 was subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of vector pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), and contained glutathione S-transferase for the N-terminal tagging, resulting in pGEX-TAO. Expression of GST-TAO in E. coli BL21(DE3) (pGEX-TAO) was induced by adding 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) when the culture optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. Cells were grown for an additional 16 hr at 20°C and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in the PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3) and crude cell extracts were prepared by using an ultrasonic disruptor (Cole-Parmer, Chicago, IL, USA) with 70% amplitude for 10 min (3.0 S on and 9.0 S off). The crude lysate was centrifuged, twice, at 18,000× g for 30 min at 4°C using PBS buffer (pH 7.3) and ammonium sulfate was added to the chilled cell extract, with stirring, to 25–35% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 20 min, resuspended in PBS buffer (pH 7.3), and filtered through polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) syringe filters (Whatman, Maidstone, England). The filtrate was passed through a Hitrap FF desalting column connected a FPLC system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The desalted elute was loaded into a GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), which was equilibrated with 5 column volumes (CV) of PBS binding buffer, and washed with 10 CV of PBS binding buffer until no material appeared in the effluent. The GST-tagged trans-anethole oxygenase was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM reduced glutathione, 10% glycerol, pH 8.8) and protein eluting at each step was applied to SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining  (Figure 1). The expression and purification of mutated and partially deleted TAO enzymes (Figure S1 in File S1) were processed by using the same methods.

24066043|t|Determination of oxygenase activity of GST-TAO
24066043|a|

24066043|t|The oxygenase activity of GST-TAO toward trans-anethole, isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole was measured by quantifying the corresponding aldehyde products by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The standard assay was carried out at 30°C for 1 hr, The 1 ml reaction mixture contained 200 nM GST-TAO, 10 mM NADH, 15 µM FAD, 150 mM sodium formate, 0.5 U formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM trans-anethole, and 1 mM 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde as internal standard. The reaction was initiated by substrate addition into reaction mixtures. Five volumes of ethyl acetate were used to extract the reaction solution. The ethyl acetate extract was evaporated in a Speed vacuum centrifugal concentrator (Vision Scientific Co., Suwon, South Korea), the residue was dissolved in 1 ml methanol, and filtered through PVDF syringe filters (Whatman, Maidstone, England). The amounts of remaining parent compounds, aldehyde product, and internal standard 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde in the reaction solutions were determined by HPLC. Each metabolite was identified by comparison to its retention time on the HPLC column, and by UV spectrum, compared to corresponding authentic compound. Kinetic parameters of GST-TAO were obtained by using the nonlinear regression method, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The effect of pH on the activity of GST-TAO was investigated at 30°C in 100 mM of sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0–5.8), potassium phosphate (pH 6.2–8.0), Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0–9.0), and glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0–10.6). The effect of temperature on the activity of GST-TAO was determined by using the standard assay conditions at temperatures between 15 and 50°C. Thermal stability of GST-TAO was investigated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer or 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr and enzyme assays were performed as described above.

24066043|a|

24066043|t|Analytical HPLC was performed by using a Varian ProStar HPLC equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) and a reverse phase C18 column (5 µm particle size, 4.6 mm×25 cm, Waters, Milford, MA). The mobile phase, which was composed of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and water, was programmed as follows: 10% acetonitrile at 0 min, 60% acetonitrile at 10 min, 90% acetonitrile at 20 min, and 90% acetonitrile at 30 min. The injection volume was 10 µL, the flow rate was 1 mL/min, and UV detection was performed at 270 nm. LC/MS was performed by coupling an Alliance 2695 LC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) to a Quattro LC triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) in positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. For LC analysis, a SunFire C18 column (3.5 µm, 2.1×150 mm, Waters) was used and the mobile phase, elution program, and detection were identical to analytical HPLC described above; except the flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. For MS analysis, the source temperature, desolvation temperature, and capillary voltage were kept at 150°C, 350°C and 3.2 kV, respectively. The cone voltage was 20 V. The cone and desolvation gas were ultra-pure nitrogen at 30 and 500 L/hr, respectively. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford assay  with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. All analyses were done in triplicate.

24066043|a|

24066043|t|Due to the insolubility of recombinant TAO and His6-TAO in E. coli BL21(DE3), a GST- tagged fusion protein was selected for purifying the TAO enzyme. Recombinant GST-TAO in plasmid pGEX-TAO was found to be mainly in the soluble fraction after induction by using 0.1 mM IPTG at 20°C for 16 hours. About 23 mg of purified GST-TAO was obtained from a 2 L culture of recombinant E. coli cells (approximately OD600 = 5.0) using a series of purification steps (Table 2). The purification yield was ∼2.8% of total protein. A single, GST-TAO band of 68 kDa (calculated, 26,440 Da for GST, and 39,328 Da for TAO) was successfully observed in SDS-PAGE (Figure 1).

The conversion of trans-anethole to p-anisaldehyde followed Mechaelis-Menton kinetics, with an affinity K m of 64.70±2.40 µM and a turnover number k cat of 0.49 s−1 (Table 3). Under the same conditions, the reaction kinetics of purified GST-TAO using isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, or isosafrole as substrate were determined by measuring the amount of the corresponding aldehyde product as previously reported . Comparisons of the activity of GST-TAO to the four substrates indicated that TAO has the best catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m, 7.69 mM−1s−1) with trans-anethole as substrate. Although GST-TAO has the lowest affinity (K m, 2255.00±346.48 µM) to isoeugenol, the highest turnover number (k cat, 1.13 s−1) was observed with this substrate.

24066043|t|The activity of GST-TAO with trans-anethole as substrate and different flavin and NAD(P)H cofactors is shown in Table 4. Flavin and NAD(P)H cofactors were necessary for the activity of GST-TAO. When NADH was a hydride donor, the catalytic efficiency of GST-TAO with FAD (k cat/K m, 7.69 mM−1s−1) as a flavin cofactor was around two-fold greater than that of FMN (k cat/K m, 3.64 mM−1s−1) and riboflavin (k cat/K m, 3.64 mM−1s−1). The catalytic efficiency of TAO with NADH (k cat/K m, 7.69 mM−1s−1) was almost two-fold greater than that of NADPH (k cat/K m, 4.22 mM−1s−1). These results indicated that FAD and NADH were the best combined cofactors in the oxygenation of trans-anethole by GST-TAO (Table 4). In addition, the K m values of GST-TAO with FAD in the presence of NADH and NADPH and trans-anethole as substrate were 63.7 µM and 109.5 µM, respectively. Since the k cat values of GST-TAO to trans-anethole ranged from 0.41 to 0.52 regardless of the cofactor combination used for the reaction, the cofactors appear not to affect turnover numbers of GST-TAO. However, the variable K m values with different flavin cofactors indicated that FAD is the best flavin cofactor for substrate binding. NADH was a better hydride donor for FAD reduction and the further oxygenation reaction than was NADPH.

24066043|a|

24066043|t|In order to profile the location of oxygenase and reductase active sites in TAO, a series of partially deleted GST-TAO mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using the same method as for wild-type TAO. These mutated enzymes, which partially deleted for either their N- or C-termini, showed significantly reduced bioconversion activity (Table 5). The N-terminal GST-TAO mutants, (N1-104), (N1–174), (N1–261), and (N1–304), which partially delete the C-terminal of TAO, had relative enzyme activities of 7.3%, 6.1%, 7.6%, and 26.2% respectively (Table 5). In addition, bioconversion activity of the C-terminal GST-TAO mutant (N175–348), which partially deletes the N-terminal of TAO, was 4.7% (Table 5). A mixture of the N- and C-terminal GST-TAO mutants (N1–174), and (N175–348) did not recover the oxygenase activity. Moreover, the addition of commercial FMN-NADH reductase to the N-terminal GST-TAO mutants (N1–174), (N1–261), and (N1–304), or the C-terminal GST-TAO mutant (N175–348) also did not recover oxygenase activities (Table 5). These results indicated that the entire TAO enzyme contributed to the integrity of oxygenase activity. Figure 2 shows NADH consumptions tied to reduction of FAD by a series of the mutants and wild type GST-TAO. The N-terminal GST-TAO mutant (N1–261) consumed 123.5 µM NADH after 60 min of incubation, which is the roughly comparable amount of NADH consumed by the wild-type GST-TAO, 158.6 µM. However, the N-terminal GST-TAO mutant (N1–104), which lost more part from the C-terminal than the GST-TAO (N1–261), consumed only 50.8 µM NADH. In contrast, the C-terminal GST-TAO mutant (N175–348) lost most of its reductase activity and only consumed 12.0 µM NADH (Figure 2).

Thus, our previous assumption , which the amino acid residues, Trp-38, Thr-43, and Tyr-55, in TAO are likely to be involved in FAD binding, was tested to verify the function with purified protein of the targeted mutant. Purified point-mutated GST-TAO (W38A/T43A/Y55A) lost almost all oxygenase activity (Table 5) with no consumption of NADH (Figure 2).

The maximum activity of TAO was detected at 25°C, and an increase in temperature from 25 to 37°C resulted in loss of 90% of the activity (Figure S2A in File S1). The highest activity of TAO was observed in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 at 25°C. TAO lost about 50% of its relative bioconversion activity at pH 7.0 and 9.0 (Figure S2B in File S1).

24066043|t|Discussion
24066043|a|

24066043|t|The trans-anethole oxygenase (TAO) is a novel flavoprotein monooxygenase capable of catalyzing the oxidation of trans-anethole to p-anisaldehyde. The oxidation reaction was catalyzed without the aid of auxiliary oxidoreductase enzyme components. Although we observed that TAO had both monooxygenase and reductase activities, no monooxygenase or flavin reductase catalytic subunits were found in TAO. Thus, TAO is characterized as a novel self-sufficient flavoprotein monooxygenase.

24066043|t|The oxidation reaction of trans-anethole to p-anisaldehyde most likely proceeded via epoxidation, hydrolysis of epoxide group, and C-C bond cleavage by TAO itself , . TAO, which is likely a single component enzyme, not only has the ability to reduce flavin cofactors, but also oxidizes trans-anethole to p-anisaldehyde (Figure 3). Natural flavoprotein monooxygenases, which catalyze epoxidation reactions, have been previously reported as two-components monooxygenases . An oxidoreductase is indispensable for the supply of reduced flavin for two-components monooxygenases. The reduced flavin diffuses to oxygenase, which reacts with molecular oxygen, and yields a reactive C4a-hydroperoxyflavin species , and the substrate is bound and subjected to an epoxidation reaction . However, diffusion limitations likely reduce catalytic efficiency of these enzymes , . For this reason, efforts have been made to find or construct a single-component, self-sufficient monooxygenase , . Examples of self-sufficient monooxygenases are the Bacillus cytochrome P450 BM3 and P450 PFOR which integrate the entire P450 system in a single polypeptide , . In contrast, most cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) contain multiple-components , . Previous difficulties in finding self-sufficient monooxygenases from natural resources has led others to construct an artificial fusion between oxygenase and reductase components  and the catalytic activity of chimeric protein with the fusion of P450RhF and redox partner in engineered E. coli have been reported , . A purified chimeric enzyme PikC cytochrome P450 fused to RhFRED showed a ∼4-fold enhanced catalytic activity (k cat/K m) in hydroxylation reaction in a macrolide biosynthetic pathway .

24066043|t|In the process of reduction of flavin and oxidation of trans-anethole, TAO accepted various flavins (FAD, FMN and riboflavin) and NAD(P)H cofactors serving as electron transfer intermediates. Stoichiometry indicates that flavin accepted one hydride from NAD(P)H and reduced flavin transferred one oxygen to the organic substrate, trans-anethole. In addition, the current study indicated that FAD is the best flavin cofactor, and NADH is better than NADPH for donating electrons to the catalytic reaction. In accordance with our initial studies done with resting cell assays of heterologously expressed TAO in E. coli , the purified GST-TAO catalyzed transformation of isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole, all of which contain a 2-propenyl functional group on the aromatic ring structure. As expected, TAO had the highest catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) with its physiological substrate, trans-anethole. Isoeugenol, however, had the greatest turnover number (k cat), although the affinity for this substrate was approximately 35-fold lower than trans-anethole, likely due to the presence of the relatively hydrophilic 4-hydroxyl group in its chemical structure.

The combined results of reductase activity (Figure 2) and FAD binding ability (Table 6) between GST-TAO (N1–174) and GST-TAO (N1–104) further indicated that the amino acids in positions 104 to 174 were critical to the FAD reduction reaction. These residues also may contribute to the binding of NADH to the enzyme. However, it should be noted that deletion of any portion of TAO resulted in loss of oxygenase activity, which is different from the reductase activity. Furthermore, the three residues Trp-38, Thr-43, and Tyr-55, which appear to be involved in FAD binding reported in our previous study , were confirmed to be flavin binding sites by using a FAD binding assay.

24066043|t|In summary, in this study we describe the identification and characterization of a novel self-sufficient trans-anethole oxygenase which was able to catalyze the epoxidation and cleavage of the carbon-carbon double on the 1-propenyl side chain of trans-anethole to produce p-anisaldehyde. In addition, the enzyme also coupled flavin reduction by another portion, flavin reductase. Based on the use of partial deletion mutants and point-mutations, the role of each segment in TAO for reductase and oxygenase activities could be deduced. Despite these results, however, it is necessary to further study for the catalytic mechanism of TAO by using structural analysis. We expect this single component self-sufficient trans-anethole oxygenase will provide another novel model system for uncovering the enzymatic function of oxygenases. Moreover, this novel enzyme has great potential as an efficient catalyst for use in the flavor and fragrance industries.

24089671|t|Total Marrow Irradiation as Part of Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Asian Patients with Multiple Myeloma
24089671|a|

24089671|t|To compare the outcomes of melphalan 200 mg/m2 (HDM200) and 8 Gy total marrow irradiation (TMI) delivered by helical tomotherapy plus melphalan 140 mg/m2 (HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy) in newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) Asian patients. Between 2007 and 2010, nine consecutive myeloma patients who were scheduled to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were studied. The patients received three cycles of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) regimen as induction chemotherapy, and if they had a partial response, peripheral blood stem cells were collected by dexamethasone-etoposide-cyclophosphamide-cisplatin (DECP). In arm A, six patients received the HDM200. In arm B, three patients received HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy. In arm B, the neutropenic duration was slightly longer than in arm A (P = 0.048). However, hematologic recovery (except for neutrophils), transfusion requirement, median duration of hospitalization, and the dose of G-CSF were similar in both arms. The median duration of overall survival and event-free survival was similar in the two arms (P = 0.387). As a conditioning regiment, HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy provide another chance for MM Asian patients who were not feasible for HDM200.

24089671|t|1. Introduction
24089671|a|

24089671|t|The outcome of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) patients for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) is superior to that of patients receiving conventional chemotherapy. Attal et al. reported that 8 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) plus 140 mg/m2 intravenous melphalan (HDM140) improved the response rate and overall survival compared with conventional chemotherapy in patients with MM. The impact of complete response (CR) achievement has been shown with high dose preconditioning. To improve survival, the objective is to increase CR rates before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT); a total of 200 mg/m2 melphalan (HDM200) without TBI is an alternative method. The Intergroupe Francophone du Mye'lome (IFM) 9502 trial compared the conditioning regimen 8 Gy TBI + HDM140 and HDM200 without TBI followed by ASCT. The results revealed that HDM200 could be an alternative conditioning regimen for MM.

24089671|t|The complications cause by TBI have been reported. The pulmonary complications were concerned by TBI position, with beam energy (P = 0.02) and the absence of lung shielding. Helical tomotherapy (HT, Tomotherapy Hi-Art System, v. 3.2.2.35., TomoTherapy Inc., Madison, WI) is new CT-based rotational intensity modulated radiotherapy. Total marrow irradiation (TMI) with HT is designed to avoid the complications of TBI while achieving the effectiveness of TBI. Dosimetric studies showed reduced doses to adjacent critical normal organs reduced toxicity after TMI. The advantages, acute toxicities, initial clinical experiences, and challenges of TMI were reported recently. 
24089671|a|

24089671|t|Recently, we reported the Asian experience with treating newly diagnosed MM patients with 8 Gy TMI by HT plus HDM140; patients subsequently received maintenance therapy with thalidomide and dexamethasone. We found that HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy regimen was an acceptable conditioning regimen for MM patients. The preliminary outcomes were similar for Asians as for other races. In the current follow-up study, we compared the acute and early chronic toxicities, CR rates, very good partial response (VGPR) rates, and early results of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy or HDM200 without TBI followed by ASCT.

24089671|t|2.1. Patient Characteristics
24089671|a|

24089671|t|We enrolled nine consecutive myeloma patients who underwent ASCT at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (diagnosed between 2007 and 2010). Eligibility criteria included age less than 65 years and symptomatic MM. Patients were excluded if they had the following: (1) stable stage I MM (Durie-Salmon classification); (2) previous cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy; (3) severe abnormalities of cardiac, pulmonary, or hepatic function; or (4) serum creatinine levels >2 mg/dL. All patients gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.

24089671|t|2.2. Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Regimen
24089671|a|

24089671|t|The treatment protocol was modified from the Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome 9502 randomized trial. Briefly, the patients received three cycles of the vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) regimen, as in the trial (Figure 1). If they achieved a partial response (M-protein reduced by <50%), then they received one course of dexamethasone-etoposide-cyclophosphamide-cisplatin (DECP) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization. Two weeks later, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were collected. Stem cells were collected after G-CSF priming (10 μg/kg/d) in steady state. Daily apheresis was continued until at least 2 × 106 CD34 cells per kilogram were collected. No CD34+ selection was performed. Two weeks after PBSC collection, the evaluation for ASCT was done. If cardiopulmonary, hepatic, and renal functions remained adequate, the patients received HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy or HDM200; the time from pre-HSCT evaluation to start of HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy or HDM200 (preconditioning) treatment was about 4 weeks. All of the patients received thalidomide for maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation.

In arm B, patients received 8 Gy TMI by HT delivered in four fractions over a 4-day period (days 6, 5, 4, and 3) plus HDM140. HDM140 was administered for two days by infusion over 30 minutes, too. PBSC transplantation was performed on day 0. Hematopoietic growth factor support with G-CSF was provided on day 5 after transplantation until granulocyte recovery.

24089671|t|2.3. Radiotherapy Technique
24089671|a|

24089671|t|Details of the HT technique have been previously published. Briefly, An AccuFix Cantilever Board (WFR/Aquaplast Corporation and Q-Fix Systems, LLC, Wyckoff, New Jersey, USA) with thermoplastic fixation or type-S thermoplastics head frame (MT-CHFN-C, Civco MedTec, Kalona, Iowa, USA) with mold care cushion was used for head and shoulder immobilization. A BlueBAG BodyFIX total body cushion system (Medical Intelligence, Schwabmünchen, Germany), which used a vacuum to produce a uniform pressure, was used to fix the main trunk and extremities in place. 
24089671|a|

24089671|t|The radiotherapy was planned with patients in a supine position for head-first upper torso therapy and with feet-first lower extremity therapy. The planning CT images were performed using dual source CT (Siemens SOMATOM Definition, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) where three sets of images were acquired during normal breathing, inspiration, and shallow expiration for the upper torso. 
24089671|a|

24089671|t|All of the CT images were sent to the Pinnacle3 Treatment Planning System (Philips Healthcare, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) for contouring. The clinical target volume (CTV) included the entire skeletal system. The margins for the planning target volume (PTV) were 0.8 cm for CTV extremities and 0.5 cm for all other bones of the CTV. The organs at risk (OAR) included the brain, optic nerves, lenses, eyes, parotid glands, oral cavity, thyroid gland, bilateral lungs, esophagus, heart, liver, spleen, pancreases, kidneys, bowel, bladder, and reproductive organs. After contouring the targets and critical organs, the images and structure set were sent to the Tomotherapy Hi-Art Planning Station for processing (Tomotherapy, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA).
24089671|a|

24089671|t|The prescription dose was 200 cGy per day (in 4 fractions) for a total dose of 800 cGy to the PTV. For the planning objective, at least 95% of the volume of PTV was to receive 800 cGy, with the mean dose to the OAR reduced to 50% of the prescribed dose. The field width, pitch, and modulation factor (MF) used for the treatment planning optimization were 2.5 cm, 0.32, and 3.0 for the upper torso and 5.0 cm, 0.4, and 2.0 for the lower extremities, respectively. 
24089671|a|

24089671|t|2.4. Follow-Up and Response Criteria
24089671|a|

24089671|t|Mandatory evaluations included physical assessment, routine hemogram, and comprehensive chemistry panel, serum protein electrophoresis every 3 months, and bone radiographs and bone marrow biopsies at 30 days and 6 and 12 months post-TMI or HDM200 and yearly thereafter. Toxicity of treatment was scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Complete response (CR) was defined as the absence of serum and urinary M-protein and no more than 5% plasma cells on bone marrow. Very good partial response (VGPR) was defined as 90% or greater decrease in bone marrow plasma cells and blood M-protein levels. Partial response (PR) was defined as 50% or greater decrease in blood and bone marrow findings. Stable disease was defined as less than 25% decrease in blood and bone marrow findings for a minimum of 3 months. Progression was defined as greater than 25% increase in M protein, greater than 25% increase in bone marrow plasma cells, or new bone lesions.

24089671|a|

24089671|t|Descriptive statistical analyses were applied for patient and disease characteristics, treatment features, and toxicity. All analyses were performed using the SPSS, version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

24089671|t|3.1. Patient Population
24089671|a|

24089671|t|Nine patients were enrolled between 2007 and 2010. In arm A, six patients received the common conditioning regimen of 200 mg/m2 melphalan. In arm B, three patients received the new regimen of 8 Gy TMI plus 140 mg/m2 melphalan. All of the patients received thalidomide for maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation.

24089671|t|In arm A, one patient achieved CR and the other one achieved VGPR before ASCT. In arm B, one patient achieved VGPR before ASCT. For arm A versus arm B, the CR rate to HDT was 1/6 versus 1/3; the VGPR rate to HDT was 4/6 versus 1/3; the median OS and PFS were 1223 versus 1556 days and 982 versus 1101 days, respectively (Table 2). The PFS was similar in the two arms (P = 0.387, Figure 2). Each group had one patient death due to disease progression.

24089671|t|3.3. Toxicities
24089671|a|

24089671|t| Table 3 illustrates engraftment, hospitalization time, and transplantation-related toxicities. In arm B, the duration of neutropenia was one day longer than in arm A (P = 0.048, Table 3). Similar side effects were noted in the two groups. However, arm B experienced a shorter duration of thrombocytopenia, fewer platelet and red blood cell transfusions, and a shorter duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy than in arm A.

24089671|t|4. Discussion
24089671|a|

24089671|t|In newly diagnosed patients with MM treated with high-dose radiotherapy, the goal of the conditioning regimen is to achieve the best response rate with the least toxicity. The most widely used conditioning regimens are HDM200 and HDM140 + TBI. The Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome 90 trial prospectively compared conventional chemotherapy with high-dose radiotherapy. In this trial the conditioning regimen consisted of 8 Gy TBI plus HDM140. The CR rate after intensive therapy was 22%, and the response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival in patients with MM were improved. Furthermore, Moreau et al. compared HDM200 and HDM140 + 8 Gy TBI as conditioning regimens for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with newly diagnosed MM. They reported that HDM200 could be an alternative conditioning regimen for MM.

24089671|t| The pulmonary complications were statistically increased by prone and supine versus lateral TBI position (P = 0.02) and with 15 MV versus 9 MV beam energy (P = 0.02). A conditioning regimen of 12 Gy TBI in 6 daily fractions induces an interstitial pneumonitis incidence of about 11% in the absence of lung shielding. Fatal interstitial pneumonitis using hyperfractionated TBI with standing position was still as high as 18%. Compared with TBI technique, doses to the sensitive organs in TMI techniques were reduced by 15%–70% of the target dose or 1.7- to 7.5-fold reduction in median organ doses. Somlo et al. reported that the estimated median radiation dose to normal organs was 11% to 81% of the prescribed marrow dose. In our previous report, the dose reduction of TMI tomotherapy to various OARs of head, chest, and abdomen relative to TBI varied from 31% to 74%, 21% to 51%, and 46% to 63%, respectively. The potential advantages, acute toxicities, initial clinical experiences, and challenges of this approach were reported recently. The maximum tolerated dose for TMI was 1,600 cGy (200 cGy twice daily × 4 days). Under these doses, grade 3 or 4 nausea/emesis, fatigue, and metabolic abnormality were 2/22, 2/22, and 4/22, respectively. Wong et al. reported that grade 2 nausea and grade 1 emesis occurred only briefly on day 2 of TMI. Skin erythema, oral mucositis, esophagitis, and enteritis were not observed. In our previous experience of TMI treatment, one with grade 1 vomiting, two with grade 1 nausea, one with grade 1 mucositis, and three with grade 1 anorexia were noted. These data hit the potential dosimetric and clinical advantages of TMI. Interestingly, the outcomes for the HDM200 and HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy conditioning regimens for MM are still inconclusive. In the current study, the CR and VGPR rates for arm A and arm B were 16.7% and 33.3%, 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively. The median OS and PFS were 1223 versus 1556 days and 982 versus 1101 days, respectively (Table 2). Additionally, the PFS rate was similar (Figure 2). With similar results as HDM200, HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy provide another chance to think about for MM Asian patients who were not feasible for HDM200. However, the lower relapse probability is noted in the patients receiving the higher dose of total body irradiation. In the current study, the dose of TMI is only 8 Gy. There still are spaces to titrate the radiation dose for the Asian in the future.

24089671|t|Thalidomide has a broad spectrum of activities in multiple myeloma and is considered to improve event-free survival and OS. The multiple effects include direct inhibition of myeloma cell growth and survival, direct stimulation of the cellular immune system, modulation of integrins compromising the adhesive interactions between the myeloma cells and bone marrow stroma, and antiangiogenic effects. Previous studies demonstrated the impact of thalidomide maintenance of response after stem cell transplantation that improved event-free survival, complete response rate, and PFS rate. In the current study, since the median PFS was similar between the groups, HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy appears to be as effective as HDM200 for Asians with MM.

24089671|t|Compared with HDM200, HDM140 + TBI had a greater toxicity regarding severe mucositis, duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions, number of days on antibiotics, and duration of hospitalization. In the total therapy program, Barlogie et al. used HDM200 for the second transplantation in responding patients. They found that HDM140 + 8.5- to 10-Gy TBI was quite toxic, and only 10% of the patients had no serious extramedullary toxicity. Treatment-related mortality was 2% with the second autotransplantation using HDM200 alone and rose to 5% with added TBI. In another retrospective evaluation, the duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the HDM200 cohort compared with HDM140 + TBI or HDM140 + busulfan cohort. No treatment-related mortality was noted in the current study. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for engraftment, duration of thrombocytopenia, number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions, duration of antibiotic infusion days, and hospitalization time. HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy provided the similar effects and toxicities of a conditioning regimen as HDM200 dosing.

24089671|t|Moreau et al. noted slower engraftment after HDM140 + TBI, despite the higher median number of CD34 cells infused than with HDM200 (7.3 versus 5, P = 0.03). Furthermore, compared with pregraft and normal control samples, patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation revealed that conditioning regimens with TBI led more frequently to nonconfluent stromal layers. Another study group analyzed fibroblast colony-forming units, the precursor compartment for the microenvironmental lineages essential to hematopoietic stem cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The authors imply that the fibroblast damage could be due to the pretransplantation conditioning regimen. Bentley et al. described patients who remained platelet and/or red cell transfusion dependent for 100 days or more after transplantation even after substantial neutrophil recovery. A significantly higher proportion of these patients had received TBI as part of their conditioning regimen. Together with these data, TBI may in some cases impair the early and late capacities of the marrow microenvironment to support transplanted stem cells. We noted similar median numbers of CD34 cells infused and numbers of red blood cell and platelet transfusions in both groups, except for the duration of neutropenia. These data suggest a potential benefit of TMI that could diminish impairment of the marrow microenvironment and provide similar results as HDM200.

24089671|t|There are some limitations to our current study. First, the small case number and the retrospective study design make statistical conclusions highly tentative. However, in the current study, the percentages of stage III for both groups were more than 80%. With the similar progression-free survival days for both groups, HDM 140 + TMI regimen provided another chance for multiple myloma Asian patients who could not tolerate HDM200 regimen. Second, the follow-up time was short so that late effects are insufficiently addressed.

24089671|a|

24089671|t|Based on these preliminary data, we are encouraged by the clinical results of HDM140 + TMI 8 Gy treatment of Asian patients with MM. This regimen has manageable toxicity and is at least as effective of a conditioning regimen as HDM200. Further evaluation is needed to learn what longer-term effect the regimen will have on disease control. Additionally, long-term followup is needed to characterize the long-term toxicities and assess the full impact in this new approach to ASCT pretreatment in Asian patients with MM.

24386148|t|Study on the Apoptosis Mechanism Induced by T-2 Toxin
24386148|a|
24386148	44	53	T-2 Toxin	Chemical	MESH:D013605

24386148|t|T-2 toxin is known to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. The mechanism of apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin has been proposed to be linked with oxidative stress and mitochondrial pathway. In the current study, the toxic effect of T-2 on Hela, Bel-7402, and Chang liver cells was examined in dose-dependent and time-dependent manner by MTT assay. Caspase-3 was found to be up-regulated under T-2 toxin stress, which suggested that T-2 toxin induced cell apoptosis. Endogenous GSH and MDA levels in all three cell lines were found down- and up-regulated respectively, which indicated the link between toxic effect of T-2 toxin and intracellular oxidative stress. It was also found by MTT assay that NAC, which maintained the level of GSH in cells, could protect cells from death. Western-blot result showed that the level of both activated Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 increased when cells were treated by T-2 toxin. Caspase-9 was found to be activated earlier than Caspase-8. It was also found that p53 was up-regulated under T-2 toxin stress in the study. These results implied that the effect of T-2 toxin on cells was apoptosis rather than necrosis, and it was probably induced through mitochondrial pathway. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show that JunD is down-regulated in T-2 toxin induced apoptosis. By construction of an over-expression vector for the JunD gene, we observed that the survival ratio of JunD over-expressed cells obviously increased under T-2 toxin stress. These results suggested that the mechanism of T-2 induced cell death was closely connected with oxidative stress, and that JunD plays an important role in the defensive process against T-2 toxin stress.

24386148|t|Introduction
24386148|a|

24386148|t|T-2 toxin, a fungal secondary metabolite, is one of the type A Trichothecenes , . Ingestion by humans or livestock of cereals contaminated by T-2 toxin can cause adverse reactions, such as vomit, diarrhea, and even death , . Alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA), mainly due to ingestion of cereal containing large amounts of T-2 toxin has been reported to cause the death of a large number of people . Injection of large dose of T-2 toxin to rat caused cardiomyopathy, which was similar to the symptom of ATA , . In view of the great harm to the health of human and livestock, the toxicological effects of T-2 toxin was reported in the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives , –.

24386148|t|It was reported that T-2 toxin could affect protein synthesis by its affinity with trans-peptidase, one of the important subunits in ribosome, and the biosynthesis of DNA and RNA were also inhibited by T-2 toxin , . It was also found that T-2 toxin could interfere with the cytomembrane phosphorylation and cause lipid peroxidation in liver . Islam et al. (1998) reported that the effect of T-2 toxin on mice thymocytes was apoptosis . Shinozuka et al. (1997) also found that the T-2 toxin induced lymphocyte death was by apoptosis . It was confirmed by in situ hybridization that the apoptotic process was accompanied by DNA damage . Wang et al. (2012) further reported that JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) might play an important role in the trichothecenes induced apoptosis . T-2 toxin mainly acted on the metabolically active organs, such as spleen, thymus, marrow, stem cells, and so on , , . The apoptotic process is initiated by a series of oxidative stress, and subsequently cells enter the mitochondrial death pathway , . It was reported that T-2 toxin not only could down-regulate intracellular reduced GSH (Glutathione), but also could up-regulate intracellular total ROS (Reactive oxygen species) , which showed intrinsic link between T-2 toxin-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. But the mechanism of how oxidative stress induces apoptosis is still unclear.

24386148|t|JunD, a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, regulates genes involved in antioxidant defense. Gerald et al. (2004) found that JunD could reduce angiogenesis in tumor by reducing ROS, and demonstrated that JunD involved in regulation of antioxidant defense . Toullec et al. (2010) took advantage of JunD deletion cell strain to examine the role of ROS in tumor development, and uncovered the role of JunD in the suppression of the migratory properties of stromal fibroblasts, which in turn potentiate tumor dissemination . However, there are still not any reports on the effect of JunD in the process of apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin.

24386148|t|MTT assay was used to detect the inhibition effect of T-2 toxin on cells. It could be concluded from Figure 1A that T-2 toxin was toxic to three lines of cells (Hela, Bel-7402, and Chang liver cell), and the virulence of T-2 toxin was different towards different cells. With the increase of the toxin dose, the cell mortality was increased, too. According to the method provided above, LC50 of T-2 toxin at 24 h to three cell lines (Hela, Bel-7402, and Chang liver cells) was found to be 357, 63, and 412 ng/mL respectively. The concentrations of T-2 toxin used in subsequent experiments were the LC50 of T-2 toxin presented above. Time effect was also observed when cells were stressed under LC50 of T-2 toxin. It could be found from the Figure 1B that as the time of T-2 stress extended, the survival rates of all three cell lines were decreasing obviously. It indicated that the effect of T-2 toxin on cells survival rate was not only dose-dependent, but also time-dependent.

24386148|t|Endogenic GSH is an important antioxidant in cells, and its level impacts on cell anti-oxidative capacity directly. The decrease in GSH level would initiate intracellular oxidative stress. It could be found from Figure 2A that with the elongation of T-2 toxin treatment time, endogenic GSH in these cells was gradually reduced, and the endogenous GSH in test groups was less than half of that in the control group at 24 h. This indicated that the level of endogenous GSH would decrease when The cells were induced by T-2 toxin, and certain degree of oxidative stress took place in the cells. This was a hint for us to explore the level of MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation. The level of MDA inside cells usually increases significantly, when the cells are under oxidative stress. As shown in Figure 2B, all three cell lines produced different levels of MDA under T-2 toxin stress, and the level of MDA was gradually increased with the elongation of the treatment time. These results and previous reports showed that there was a link between the T-2 toxin stress and intracellular oxidative stress.

It could be found from Figure 3A that the survival rate of NAC pretreated Hela cells increased compared to the control group, which meant that the antioxidant NAC could relief the virulence of T-2 toxin, and alleviate T-2 toxin induced cell death. Endogenous GSH was detected, and the result from Figure 3B showed that there was more GSH in NAC pretreated Hela cells. But no obvious protective effect of NAC to the Chang liver and Bel-7402 cell lines under T-2 toxin stress was observed (data no shown). These results suggested that the pernicious effect of T-2 toxin on cells was at least partially caused by oxidative stress, and the protective effect of NAC to Hela cells against T-2 toxin stress was through protecting GSH.

24386148|t|Caspase 3, an important factor in apoptosis, is activated in both death ligand and mitochondrial pathways. In cell, Caspase 3 is an enzyme precursor that is activated only when cell initiates an apoptotic process. In the study, the hydrolase activity of Caspase 3 was detected to reflect the activity level of Caspase-3 in cells (Hela, Bel-7402, and Chang liver) under T-2 toxin stress. It could be observed from Figure 4A that the activity of Caspase-3 in three cell lines under T-2 toxin stress was increased 2–7 times compared to control group at 24 h. These results reflected that Caspase-3 played an important role in the process, and preliminary suggested that the process induced by T-2 toxin in cells was apoptosis.

The results of our Western-blot analysis (Figure 5) in present study showed that Caspase-8 was hydrolyzed and activated at about 16 h, and Caspase-9 was activated at about 8 h (Figure 5A and B). The same situation happened to the line of Bel-7402, and Caspase-8 was hydrolyzed and activated relatively later than that of Caspase-9. Caspase-8 was activated at about 24 h, but Caspase-9 was about 16 h (Figure 5C). These results indicated that the apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin was probably through mitochondrial pathway, which coincided with the previous reports , .

Some reports declared that the level of p53 did not change in the T-2 toxin mediated apoptosis , other reports found that p53 level was up-regulated in the process . So it is necessary to further clarify the role of p53 played in the apoptotic process. We found that the protein level of p53 in these three cell lines (Hela, Chang liver, and Bel-7402) was up-regulated under T-2 toxin stress (Figure 6 A–C) suggesting that p53 took part in the apoptotic process induced by T-2 toxin.

By Western-blot analysis, we found that the protein levels of intracellular JunD were obviously suppressed under T-2 toxin stress in all three cell lines we used ( Figure 7A ). The down-regulation of JunD results in the suppression of intracellular antioxidant system, which makes the cells susceptible to oxidative stress.

24386148|t|Discussion
24386148|a|

24386148|t|It had been found in many reports that intracellular reduced GSH was down-regulated by T-2 toxin, and at the same time, lipid oxidation occurred and total intracellular ROS was up-regulated , . Reduced GSH can effectively remove intracellular free radicals, and the decline in GSH expression level would lead to unbalance of intracellular antioxidant system. The up-regulated ROS and MDA reflected that cells had been coerced by oxidative stress. In the current study, it was clear that all three cell lines (Hela, Bel-7402, and Chang liver) could be induced into the process of apoptosis by T-2 toxin, and the death effect of the toxin against cells was time-dependent and dose-dependent. Oxidative stress might be the main factor which leads to apoptosis under T-2 toxin stress. In the experiment in which antioxidant NAC was used to pretreat cells. The cell line, Hela, was protected efficiently under T-2 toxin stress, but there was no significant effect in Bel-7402 and Chang liver. This may be due to the different sensitivity to NAC for different cell lines. He et al. (2012) also found that NAC could provide a protective effect towards the apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin . From the reports and results provided above, it could be concluded that oxidative stress plays an important role in apoptosis triggered by T-2 toxin.

In the current study, it was suggested that T-2 toxin induced cells apoptosis rather than necrosis by increasing the expression level of Caspase-3 . Caspase-8 plays an important role in death receptor pathway, and Caspase-9 takes part in the mitochondrial pathway , . Therefore, The pathway of T-2 toxin induced apoptosis could be illustrated by detecting the protein level of the both proteins. In this study, it was found that the activation of Caspase-9 (about 8 h) was earlier than that of Caspase-8 (about 24 h). So it implied that the apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin was mainly by mitochondrial pathway.

24386148|t|The tumor suppressor p53 plays a very important role in maintaining the integrity of cellular genes and controlling cell growth. So the expression of p53 inside cell is subjected to strict regulation. The apoptosis induced by p53 is through mitochondrial pathway by activating transcription of some pro-apoptotic factors (such as Puma, Bax, p53AIP1, Bcl2, PIGs and so on) , . In previous studies of T-2 toxin induced apoptosis, the role of p53 has been controversial. Some studies have reported that p53 does not change in the process , whereas some results confirm that p53 is up-regulated in the process , . Thus, we found it is important to clarify the role of p53 in T-2 toxin induced apoptosis. It was confirmed in the present study that p53 was up-regulated, which also suggested that the pathway of T-2 induced apoptosis was through the mitochondrial pathway .

24386148|t|AP-1 (activator protein-1) transcription factor family plays a key role in the regulation of transcription by Ras which is mainly composed of c-Jun,JunB, and JunD, and it is usually considered that JunD plays an important role in intracellular antioxidant system –. These evidences revealed that there might be an intrinsic link between JunD and oxidative stress, but there is no report about JunD in the study of T-2 toxin induced apoptosis. In our study, we found that JunD was of importance in the apoptotic process induced by T-2 toxin. Initially, we found by Western-blot analysis that the protein levels of JunD were down-regulated in the T-2 toxin induced apoptosis. In further studies on the cell survival rate during T-2 toxin stress, we found that the JunD over-expression cell lines could effectively prevent the effects induced by T-2 toxin. However, there was no obvious difference in the survival rate between wild-type cell lines and JunD interfered cell lines, which might suggest that there are other factors that could complement the function of JunD. Thus, we conclude that JunD could effectively protect cells from T-2 toxin induced apoptosis. It is, however, still unclear how JunD protected the cells from apoptosis under T-2 toxin stress. Further study on the pathway by which JunD prevent apoptosis would illuminate the molecular mechanism of T-2 induced apoptosis.

24451144|t|Oxidative stress (OS) is related to vascular inflammation possibly, contributing to the development of coronary ectasia (CE). Base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair are the main DNA repair pathways that can help to remove 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OHdG), a marker of OS. Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) is a key enzyme of the BER pathway and catalyzes the removal of 8-OHdG. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys gene polymorphism and CE in a Chinese population. Five-hundred forty-seven patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography in a tertiary medical center were recruited. The angiographic definition of CE is the diameter of the ectatic segment being more than 1.5 times larger compared with an adjacent healthy reference segment. The gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The urine 8OHdG concentration was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. The distribution of hOGG1 Ser326Cys genotypes was significantly different between CE and non-CE groups (p = 0.033). The odds ratio of CE development for the Ser to the Cys variant was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04–2.31, p = 0.033). Both univariate and logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in the dominant model with CE development (p = 0.009 and 0.011, respectively). Urine 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in subjects carrying the hOGG1 Ser variant than in those with the Cys/Cys genotype (p < 0.03). In conclusion, our study suggests that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys gene variant might play a role in susceptibility to the development of CE.

24451144|t|Introduction
24451144|a|

24451144|t|Coronary ectasia (CE) is an uncommon disease, and its incidence is usually between 0.3% and 5% in different studies [1–5]. It has been defined as the diameter of the ectatic segment being more than 1.5 times larger compared with an adjacent healthy reference segment [2]. Most cases of CE are considered as a variant of coronary artery disease (CAD) [6]. Although the pathogenesis of CE is not completely understood, it is likely to involve the destruction of the arterial media, increased wall stress, thinning of the arterial wall and progressive dilatation of the coronary artery segment [7]. In addition, CE is also reported to be associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers, cytokines and oxidative stress [8–10].
24451144|a|

24451144|t|Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a biological system’s ability to detoxify the reactive intermediates and repair the resulting damage. It is thought to be involved in the development of many human diseases, including atherosclerosis [11,12]. Oxidative stress is usually associated with increased free radical formation and causes increased ROS concentrations. ROS modify proteins and phospholipids and lead to lipid peroxidation [13]. These substances may lead to inflammatory responses, such as leukocyte activation, the expression of adhesion molecules and the release of cytokines [14]. Atherosclerosis is the result of the oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the arterial wall by ROS. ROS are key mediators of signaling pathways that underlie vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis starting from the development of a fatty streak, through lesion progression to ultimate plaque rupture [15].

24451144|t|Genomic DNA is also susceptible to being attacked by ROS, and multiple DNA repair enzymes protect DNA against such oxidative damage [16]. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OHdG) is a major component of the oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive free radicals and has been considered as a key biomarker of oxidative DNA damage in the literature [17,18]. On the contrary, base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair are the main DNA repair pathways that can help to remove 8-OHdG. Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) is a key enzyme of the base excision repair pathway and catalyzes the removal of 8-OHdG [19,20]. A functional polymorphism, Ser326Cys, is the common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the hOGG1 gene and is reported to be associated with risks of several cancers, diabetes and CAD [21–29]. Because CE is correlated to atherosclerosis and oxidative stress, we aimed to investigate the association between the functional hOGG1 Ser326Cys gene polymorphism and CE in a Chinese population in this study [6,30].

24451144|t|Clinical Characteristics
24451144|a|

24451144|t|We finally enrolled 547 patients, including 53 (9.7%) patients with and 494 (90.3%) without CE. The average age is 61.8 ± 12.4 years old, and the percentage of males is 71.3%. Three-hundred seventy-four (68.4%) patients had significant CAD, including 120 (21.9%) with one-vessel disease (1VD), 96 (17.6%) with two-vessel disease (2VD) and 158 (28.9%) with three-vessel disease (3VD).
24451144|a|

24451144|t|Table 1 summarizes the demographic information between those with and without CE. There was no significant difference between sex, age, incidence of diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, history of smoking, family history of premature CAD, diseased vessels numbers, body mass index (BMI), history of previous acute coronary syndrome and the use of medications.
24451144|a|

24451144|t|Table 2 summarizes the angiographic characteristics of the patients. Four-hundred ninety-four (90.3%) patients had no CE. Among 53 patients with CE, 42 (7.7%) patients had CE involving one major vessel (right coronary artery: 29 patients; left anterior descending artery: one patient; left circumflex artery: 12 patients); eight (1.4%) patients had CE involving two major vessels (five patients with right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery; three patients with right coronary artery and left circumflex artery); and, three (0.5%) patients had CE involving all three vessels. Furthermore, we did not find significant association between the number of ectatic vessels and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism (p = 0.165).

Defining patients with hOGG1 Ser326Cys Cys/Cys genotype as the reference, the relative possibility of the presence of CE was 2.45 for patients with Ser/Cys genotype (odds ratio (OR): 2.45; 95% CI: 0.95–6.28; p = 0.063) and 2.53 for patients with Ser/Ser genotype (OR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.22–5.25; p = 0.013) (Table 3). Using the dominant genetic model (Cys/Cys vs. Ser/Cys plus Ser/Ser), patients with the Ser allele were 2.51 times more likely to have CE than Cys/Cys genotype carriers (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.23–5.11; p = 0.011).

24451144|t|Although there was no significant difference in the CAD number between non-CE and CE patients, we performed a subgroup analysis to avoid the possible influence of CAD on the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism. Among 547 study subjects, we excluded the patients with angiographic CAD in the non-CE patients to set up a control group without CAD (n = 156), and finally, 209 subjects were analyzed. Defining patients with hOGG1 Ser326Cys Cys/Cys genotype as the reference, the relative possibility of the presence of CE was 2.61 for patients with Ser/Cys genotype (OR: 2.61; 95% CI: 0.94–7.31; p = 0.067) and 2.80 for patients with Ser/Ser genotype (OR: 2.80; 95% CI: 1.28–6.13; p = 0.010) (Table 4).

Urinary 8-OHdG has been measured frequently to indicate the extent of oxidative damage, due to its simple and noninvasive technique. Numerous pieces of evidence have indicated that urinary 8-OHdG not only is a biomarker of generalized, cellular oxidative stress, but might also be a risk factor for cancer, atherosclerosis and diabetes [18,30–33]. In addition, there were many studies focusing on the functional hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism [21–29,34,35]. Aka et al. reported that the DNA repair capacity in individuals with Ser/Cys or Cys/Cys OGG1 genotypes was lower than those with the Ser/Ser hOGG1 genotype [34]. Thomas D. et al. found that the inactivation of hOGG1 increases the frequency of G–C to T–A transversion mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [35]. These studies revealed that the hOGG1 Cys326 variant causes the reduction of repair enzyme activity to remove 8-OHdG and leads to the accumulation of 8-OHdG and increases DNA damage [12].

24451144|t|CAD is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaque within the walls of the coronary arteries and is also a chronic inflammatory disease [36]. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is related to oxidative stress, which causes the oxidative modification of LDL by ROS and further leads to atherosclerotic plaques progression and possible rupture [11,12,15]. Our recent study also revealed that hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism was associated with the risk of CAD and multi-vessel disease and might be a novel genetic marker for the development and severity of CAD in the Chinese population [29].

24451144|t|CE is a variant of coronary artery abnormality [6]. It may be congenital or acquired. Acquired causes include CAD, various inflammatory and infectious diseases and Kawasaki disease [2–6,8–10]. However, most cases of CE are correlated with atherosclerosis and had the coexistence of obstructive CAD [2,6]. In addition, CE was also reported to be associated with oxidative stress in a recent study [10]. Sezen Y. et al. found that total oxidant status and the oxidative stress index were significantly increased, and the total antioxidant status was decreased in the CE group compared to the control group [10]. In the current study, we discovered that CE is significantly associated with hOGG1 Ser326Cys gene polymorphism in a dominant model after adjusting the possible confounding factors. This finding was still noted in the subgroup analysis using patients without CAD as the control group. Although CE is considered as a variant of CAD, its pathogenesis has not yet been completely illustrated. Even in patients with isolated CE without coronary stenosis, there is still a higher incidence of adverse events in this population compared to people with normal coronary arteries. CE could produce sluggish blood flow and predisposes patients to acute myocardial infarction, even without obstructed coronary arteries [37]. In the current study, we did not find a significant association between CAD and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism, which might be related to a limited sample size in comparison with our previous study. However, we discovered a significant association between CE and hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism. These results might suggest that patients with CE have greater oxidative stress than those with CAD. In addition, we also found that urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in subjects carrying the hOGG1 Ser variant than in those with the Cys/Cys genotype. These findings could further confirm the association of oxidative stress with CE and indicates that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys gene variant might play a role in the individual’s susceptibility to the development of CE in the Chinese population.

24451144|t|A previous study had reported that obesity was the only coronary risk factor that showed a statistically significant correlation with CE [38]. In this study, obesity was present in 60% of the patients who had CE, compared with 42% of patients who did not have CE. This finding is compatible with the findings in our study. In our study, higher BMI was still significantly associated with CE after multivariate regression analysis. Hence, obesity might also be a risk factor in the development of CE. The possible mechanism might be related to the interaction of connective tissue elements with lipoprotein particles, which weakens the structure of the arterial wall and the association between obesity and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism [38]. However, further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanism.
24451144|a|

24451144|t|There are several limitations of this study. First, the findings should be taken with caution, because they are based on a limited sample size. Therefore, the results need to be replicated for confirmation by further studies using larger samples. Second, the association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys genotypes and urinary 8-OHdG levels were based on limited samples from healthy subjects instead of all enrolled patients. However, our data might reduce the confounding factors and truly demonstrate the influence of the genetic variant on urine 8-OHdG concentrations. Third, since this is only a clinical association study, a detailed discussion on the potential mechanisms should be limited.

24451144|t|We consecutively evaluated patients scheduled for diagnostic coronary angiography from Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUH) in Taiwan. Patients with a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, uninterpretable restriction digest results or inadequate angiograms for evaluation were excluded. We collected patients’ demographic and baseline information, including sex, age, duration of chest pain, history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking and medication. The research protocol was approved and registered by the local institution ethics committee (KMUH-IRB), and informed consent was obtained from the patients.

24451144|a|

24451144|t|The coronary artery angiography films were reviewed by two experienced cardiologists blind to the patients’ clinical characteristics. A third reviewer blinded to the readings of the first two reviewers served as the arbitrator of the differences, if needed. Coronary angiography was performed by the femoral or radial approach with 6 French diagnostic catheters. Images were recorded in multiple projections for left and right coronary arteries. Coronary artery stenosis was determined by quantitative coronary angiography. The presence of CAD is defined as coronary diameter stenosis more than 50%. CE is defined as the diameter of the ectatic segment being more than 1.5 times larger compared with an adjacent healthy reference segment [2]. The recorded data also included the location of CAD and CE and the number and percentage of stenosis of the diseased vessels.

24451144|a|

24451144|t|Blood samples for genotyping (hOGG1 polymorphisms in codon 326, rs1052133) were collected during coronary catheterization. Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA whole blood samples following standard procedures and stored at −20 ºC. The genotype was determined with the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay (Applied Biosystems, ABI, Foster City, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. SNP allele-specific primers and probes were designed and synthesized by ABI (Foster City, CA, USA). Nucleotide primers were 5′CTCCTACAGGTGCTGTTCAGT3′ (forward primer) and 5′ACCCTTTCTGCGCTTTGCT3′ (reverse primer). The probe for Ser326 was 5′CCAATCCCGCCATGC3′, and for Cys326, it was 5′CAATGCCGCCATGC3′. Probe 5′ ends were labeled, the Cys326 probe with 6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM) and the Ser326 with 2′-chloro-7′-phenyl-1,4-dichloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (VIC). After thermal cycling (50 ºC for 2 min, 95 ºC for 10 min, then 40 cycles at 95 ºC for 15 s and at 60 ºC for 90 s), allelic discrimination was performed (Applied Biosystems 7900 real-time PCR system, ABI, Foster City, CA, USA).

24451144|a|

24451144|t|All data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. If the minor allele frequency (MAF) for hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism among the non-CE group was estimated to be 0.384, the study should enroll at least 51 patients with the non-CE group to have more than 80% statistical power to detect an association with Odds ratios (ORs) ≥ 2.5. The independent t-test was used for continuous variables analysis between two groups. The genotypic distribution was tested by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. A chi-square test was used to compare categorical data. ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as a measure of the association of hOGG1 genotypes in a different genetic analysis model with CE. The relevant correlated variables and the appropriate genetic model were further analyzed by logistic regression analysis. All p-values were two-sided with a significant level of p < 0.05. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.

24605059	0	12	Thapsigargin	Chemical	MESH:D019284

24605059|t|The objective of this study was performed to investigate the effects of thapsigargin on apoptosis, actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and actin cytoskeletal proteins in human lung adenocarcinoma cell. Thapsigargin is a specific irreversible inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, which may promote ER stress by depletion of lumenal calcium stores and show potential to induce cell death. The effects of thapsigargin on the apoptosis in A549 cells were assayed by Hoechst staining. Moreover, the F-actin staining by Rhodamine-phalloidin and RhoA antibody for cytoskeleton organizations were applied to A549 cells. To confirm the impairment of cytoskeletal dynamics treated with thapsigargin, western blots were applied to analyze the protein levels of p-Cofilin-1 (Ser3), Cofilin-1, and pPaxillin (Tyr118), as well as RhoA and pS6 (S240/244). Results suggest that thapsigargin may induce cell death in A549 cells with a time- and dose-dependent manner. The F-actin fibers and RhoA signals are also reduced with a time- and dose-dependent manner by thapsigargin treatment. The phosphorylation forms of Cofilin-1 and paxillin are attenuated by 1 μM thapsigargin treatment for 24 h. These alternations may be caused by the inhibition of of mTORC1 activities (indicated by pS6 (Ser240/244)) and RhoA pathways after thapsigargin treatment. The present findings highlight important roles of calcium entry in cytoskeleton organization and apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma cells and will help to set a stage to the clinical treatment of cancer cell metastasis.

24605059|t|1. Introduction
24605059|a|

24605059|t|Cytoskeleton is required for many biological processes, such as embryonic morphogenesis, immune surveillance, tissue repair, and regeneration. Aberrant regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics drives progression of cancer invasion and metastasis. Cancer cell metastasis is a multistage process involving invasion into surrounding tissue, intravasation, transit in the blood or lymph, extravasation, and growth at a new site. Many of these steps require cell motility, which is driven by cycles of actin polymerization and depolymerization. Actin networks consist of branched or linear filaments and regulate many essential cellular processes. The actin cytoskeleton functions in the generation and maintenance of cell morphology and polarity and in endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, contractility, motility, and cell division. The assembly and disassembly of actin filaments, as well as their organizations into functional higher-order networks, are regulated by several actin-binding proteins, many of which are conserved from yeast to human.
24605059|a|

24605059|t|Malignant cancer cells utilize their intrinsic migratory ability to invade adjacent tissues and the vasculature and ultimately to metastasize. The motility of tumor cells is driven by the polymerization of actin monomers into polarized filaments. These filaments, termed F-actin, are in a constant state of flux with new monomers being added. One of the proteins identified in F-actin formation is Cofilin-1. Cofilin-1 is an actin-depolymerizing factor and regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Phosphorylation of Cofilin-1 on Serine-3 is known to block these activities, which is regulated by RhoA GTPases through mTORC1-RhoA-Limk-Cofilin-1 pathways. Earlier results have been coupled with intracellular calcium influx and cytoskeletal dynamic in vitro and in vivo. For example, calcium influx into rat brain synaptosomes causes the breakdown of F-actin under the plasma membrane. And inhibition of actin polymerization has a biphasic time-dependent effect on calcium entry, showing an initial potentiation followed by inhibition of calcium entry. Moreover, thapsigargin, a specific irreversible inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, has been used to investigate the effect of a disturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis on different processes of cells, including cytoskeleton dynamics. It is interesting that thapsigargin-induced depletion of ER calcium stores severely inhibits F-actin contents in human monocytic cells. Thus, thapsigargin may prove to be a useful tool for investigating calcium influx and cytoskeleton dynamics underlying cell apoptosis.

24605059|t|Although progress has been made, it is still largely unknown whether the calcium influx couples with cytoskeletal dynamics and affects cell apoptosis, especially in cancer cells. To examine the critical role between calcium signaling, cytoskeleton, and cell apoptosis, we focus on the effect of ectopic entry of calcium influx by thapsigargin on actin cytoskeleton apoptosis in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that thapsigargin treatment may induce cell death in A549 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. For ectopic entry of calcium influx being induced thapsigargin, we find that the cytoskeletal dynamics is impaired by thapsigargin treatment, indicated by F-actin staining and biochemical evidence. The effects of thapsigargin on cell death in A549 tumor cells may be mediated by mTORC1-RhoA-Cofilin-1 pathway, because thapsigargin treatment may dramatically inhibit mTORC1 activity and RhoA protein level. Our work will help to understand a novel clue regarding the relationship between calcium signaling, cytoskeleton, and cell apoptosis in A549 tumor cells.

The cell lysate supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at l0000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations of the cell supernatants were evaluated and measured by BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of the proteins from each extract were separated in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.6%) with 5% stacking gel in SDS-Tris-glycine running buffer. The proteins were then transferred electrophoretically using a PVDF membrane by standard procedures. The membranes were then blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature and probed overnight by proper primary antibodies diluted in PBST at 4°C. The membranes were rinsed 3 times with PBST and incubated with proper secondary antibodies diluted in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the membranes were rinsed another 3 times with PBST at room temperature for 10 min, and proteins were detected by Super Signal enhanced chemiluminescence development (ECL) (Thermo Scientific Pierce) reagent and exposed to films (Kodak). The protein level quantification was carried out by ImageJ.

24605059|t|To examine whether the thapsigargin treatment may induce the cell death in A549 cells, we applied Hoechst staining to A549 cells treated by thapsigargin (Figure 1). The results show that thapsigargin has slight effects on cell death at the final concentration of 1 nM (cell death by 5.2%) or 100 nM (by 7.4%) for 6 h treatment (Figure 1(b)). The percentage of cell death increases significantly to 24.1% at the concentration of 1 μM (Figure 1(b)). To examine whether the effects of thapsigargin on cell death of A549 cells is time-dependent or not, we prolonged the treated time of thapsigargin on A549 cells to 24 h. Our results suggest that the percentages of cell death increase to 9.4% (1 nM), 25.8% (100 nM), and 41.2% (1 μM) after thapsigargin treatment (Figure 1(b)). These findings support the notion that thapsigargin may induce cell death in A549 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

24605059|t|To study the cellular mechanisms of how thapsigargin induces cell death in A549 cells, we focused on the cytoskeletal dynamics, because we noted that A549 cells tended to shrink after thapsigargin treatment (Data not shown). Thus, we carried out F-actin staining by Rhodamine labeled Phalloidin probes in A549 cells. Being consistent with Hoechst stainings, our results show that the F-actin fibers are reduced in a time- and dose-dependent manner after thapsigargin treatment (Figure 2). Moreover, RhoA signals, indicated by the greed-fluorescence, are also reduced after thapsigargin treatment, in parallel with Rhodamine-phalloidin signals, while DAPI signals labelled blue indicate the nuclear locations (Figure 2). The parallel reduction of F-actin and RhoA signals by thapsigargin treatment confirms that thapsigargin may impair the cytoskeleton dynamics and organizations.

24605059|t|To confirm the impairment of cytoskeletal dynamics in thapsigargin treated A549 cells, we examined the cellular pathways regulating F-actin organizations. By western blots, we show that Cofilin-1 phosphorylations are reduced after thapsigargin treatment, while the total protein levels of Cofilin-1 are not altered (Figure 3(a)). The ratio of p-Cofilin-1 to Cofilin-1 reduces to 67.4% after thapsigargin treatment of 1 μM for 6 h, and to 40.9% after 1 μM for 24 h (Figure 3(b)). Consistently, the phosphorylation of paxillin is also reduced to 33.9% after 1 μM thapsigargin treatment for 24 h (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). It is of note that the protein level of p-Paxillin is not altered with statistical difference after 1 μM thapsigargin treatment for 6 h (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). This may be due to the delay effect of thapsigargin on regulator molecules of cytoskeletons. Taken together, our findings suggest that thapsigargin treatment may impair the balance of cytoskeletal dynamics, depolymerizing actin fibers, and inhibiting actin reorganizations.

24605059	5	17	Thapsigargin	Chemical	MESH:D019284

24605059|t|To study the molecular mechanism of thapsigargin's effect on cytoskeleton dynamics, the protein levels of mTORC1 indicators and downstream factor RhoA were examined. Our results reveal that the protein levels of pS6 (Ser240/244), a well-known indicator of mTORC1 activity, are reduced to 61.1% (1 μM for 6 h) and non-detectable (1 μM for 24 h) after thapsigargin treatment (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Subsequently, the protein levels of RhoA, a key regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, are also reduced to 52.9% (1 μM for 6 h) and 17.7% (1 μM for 24 h) after thapsigargin treatment (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). The reduction of RhoA protein levels is consistent with previous reduction of signals of RhoA immunostaining after thapsigargin treatment (Figure 2). These results indicated that thapsigargin may impair cytoskeletal dynamics through mTOR-RhoA pathways in A549 cells.

24605059|t|4. Discussion
24605059|a|

24605059|t|Cancer progression is a multistep process that enables tumor cells to disperse to points far from a given primary tumor mass, and this often leads to metastasis. Cell movement through tissue thus plays a crucial and primary role in cancer progression. This process requires a series of distinct but concerted biological events in which the actin cytoskeleton plays essential roles. In decades, our understanding of the molecules involved in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics has increased. Thapsigargin has been reported to induce cell death in several tumor cell lines, by either increasing the store-mediated calcium entry or ER stress. It has been reported that thapsigargin treatment rapidly induce a sustained increase in calcium concentration and DNA fragmentation and induce cell death by altering cell morphology or activating apoptotic pathways. In the present study, we demonstrate that thapsigargin, a specific irreversible inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, induces cell death by impairing the cytoskeletal dynamics and actin organizations in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. This process may be mediated by the mTOR-RhoA-Cofilin-1 pathways, because thapsigargin treatment may dramatically inhibit mTORC1 activity, and reduce RhoA proteins and attenuating Cofilin-1 phosphorylations (Figure 4(c)). mTOR is a central controller of cell proliferation, growth, and survival and functions in cells at least as two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. It has been reported that mTOR pathways regulate tumor cell migration and cancer metastasis. For example, rapamycin suppresses IGF-1 stimulated F-actin reorganization and migration in various tumor cell lines by inhibiting mTORC1 activity. Rapamycin may also inhibit F-actin reorganization and cell motility by downregulation of RhoA protein expression and activity. Our findings highlight an important role of calcium entry in cytoskeleton organization and apoptosis and set a stage to the clinical treatment of tumor cell metastasis.

24605059|t|The actin cytoskeleton functions in the generation and maintenance of cell morphology and polarity, in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, contractility, motility, and cell division. The assembly and disassembly of actin filaments, as well as their organization into functional higher-order networks, are regulated by several extracellular and intracellular signalings. Thapsigargin activates of calcium entry following the depletion of intracellular calcium stores and couples with cytoskeleton organizations. For example, thapsigargin has been reported to induce actin depolymerization and produce a net decrease in F-actin content in human monocytic cells. In turn, prolonged treatment of inhibitors of actin polymerisation abolishes calcium entry by 50% in human platelets. Thus, the coupling of calcium signaling and actin cytoskeletal dynamics need to be further consolidated. Our findings reveal that ectopic opening of calcium influx by thapsigargin may disrupt the organizations of actin cytoskeletons, which may help to understand the relationship of calcium signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.

24605059|t|It is well established that increased F-actin may promote cell longevity, whereas decreased actin turnover seems to trigger cell death. The actin regulatory protein Cofilin-1 has been shown to have a key role in the apoptotic process. Cofilin-1 is a member of the Cofilin-1/ADF (actin depolymerizing factor) family and regulates actin dynamics by promoting the depolymerization and severing of actin filaments, and regulating the recycling of the resulting monomers. It has been shown that the active (dephosphorylated) form of Cofilin-1 is targeted to mitochondria after initiation of apoptosis. Mitochondrial targeting of Cofilin-1 is sufficient to induce cytochrome c leakage from the mitochondria and strongly induced apoptosis. Moreover, paxillin, a multidomain protein, is one of the key components of for integrin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization. In tumor cells, paxillin is highly phosphorylated at Tyr118 and recruits other signalling molecules to focal adhesions for tumor metastasis. In the present study, our findings suggested that thapsigargin treatment may dramatically reduce Cofilin-1 phosphorylations and increase its activity (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)), which contribute to the actin depolymerization and initiation of apoptosis. To clarify how thapsigargin inhibits Cofilin-1 phosphorylations, we focus on the mTOR-RhoA pathways. mTOR has been shown to integrate signals from a variety of extracellular inputs, including growth factors, amino acids, glucose, ATP, and oxygen. mTOR-dependent signaling modulates numerous cellular properties, including cell proliferation, cell motility, and protein translation. Inhibition of mTOR kinase activity by rapamycin impairs mTOR-mediated protein synthesis and activities of the small GTPases (e.g., RhoA), leading to inhibition of F-actin organization and cell motility. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on expression of RhoA is also observed in other tumor cell lines, including those derived from cervical cancer (HeLa), prostate cancer (PC-3), Ewing sarcoma (Rh1), and glioblastoma (U-373), suggesting that this is not cell-type dependent. Here, our results suggested that thapsigargin may also down-regualte mTOR kinase activity and inhibit RhoA protein level in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. These findings may contribute to the impairment of actin cytoskeletons by thapsigargin. Thus, our work has set up links of calcium influx, mTOR-RhoA pathways, and cytoskeletal dynamics.

24605059|t|5. Conclusion
24605059|a|

24605059|t|In summary, the present studies reveal that ectopic calcium influx by thapsigargin inhibits mTOR kinase activity and RhoA expressions, thus leading to the increasing of Cofilin-1 activity and actin depolymerizations. The impairment of actin cytoskeletal dynamics finally triggers cell death in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our work suggests that therapies that specifically target calcium-cytoskeleton signaling molecules may prove useful for the treatment of tumor cell metastasis.

24672387|t|Aliphatic amines, including methylamine, are air-pollutants, due to their intensive use in industry and the natural degradation of proteins, amino acids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds in biological samples. It is necessary to develop systems for removal of methylamine from the air, since airborne methylamine has a negative effect on human health. The primary amine oxidase (primary amine : oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) or amine oxidase, AMO; EC 1.4.3.21), a copper-containing enzyme from the thermotolerant yeast Hansenula polymorpha which was overexpressed in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was tested for its ability to oxidize airborne methylamine. A continuous fluidized bed bioreactor (CFBR) was designed to enable bioconversion of airborne methylamine by AMO immobilized in calcium alginate (CA) beads. The results demonstrated that the bioreactor with immobilized AMO eliminates nearly 97% of the airborne methylamine. However, the enzymatic activity of AMO causes formation of formaldehyde. A two-step bioconversion process was therefore proposed. In the first step, airborne methylamine was fed into a CFBR which contained immobilized AMO. In the second step, the gas flow was passed through another CFBR, with alcohol oxidase from the yeast H. polymorpha immobilized in CA, in order to decompose the formaldehyde formed in the first step. The proposed system provided almost total elimination of the airborne methylamine and the formaldehyde.

24672387|t|1. Introduction
24672387|a|

24672387|t|Outdoor and indoor organic air-pollutants pose a serious threat to public health. According to estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 800,000 people worldwide die annually from diseases caused by the effects of air-pollution []. Methylamine (MA) is the simplest primary amine which is used to produce a variety of important chemical products: pharmaceuticals, pesticides, fuel additives, explosives, solvents, cleaning agents, photographic processing reagents, and chemicals for the tanning of leather and dye processes. MA pollutes the air because of its intensive use in industry and as a result of natural degradation of proteins, amino acids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds in biological samples. Exposure to MA at normal background levels is unlikely to have any negative effects on human health. However, inhalation of air that contains high levels of MA can result in a number of adverse health effects, such as breathing difficulties, a burning sensation, sore throat, headache, and accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) []. MA can be found in very high concentrations in some kinds of fish, especially of the Gadoid species, due to the enzymatic degradation of a natural osmolyte, trimethylamine N-oxide [, ].

A two-step continuous fluidized bed bioreactor (CFBR) based on immobilized AMO (step 1) and alcohol oxidase (AOX) (step 2) was designed for bioconversion of airborne MA and the formaldehyde (FA) which is produced in this process.

24672387|a|

24672387|t|The pYEX-4T-1 plasmid (CLONTECH) was modified prior to cloning of the AMO gene. The fragment of the vector containing the CUP1 promoter and GST was cut out. The sequence encoding the CUP1 promoter was amplified by PCR and inserted into the plasmid to produce pYEX4T-1-delGST. In order to clone the H. polymorpha AMO gene into pYEX4T-1-delGST BamHI and NotI restriction sites as well as the sequence encoding for (His)6-tag were introduced by amplifying the gene with the primers AMO-for and AMO-rev. The pADES-AMO plasmid was used as a template []. The PCR product containing the AMO gene was cleaved with BamHI and NotI restrictases (Fermentas, Lithuania) and cloned into pYEX-4T-1-del-GST. The resulting plasmid was marked as pYEX-4-AMO (Figure 1), and the correct nucleotide sequence of the AMO reading frame was confirmed by sequencing.

24672387|t|The cells were resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-sulfate buffer, pH 9.4, and treated with 10 mM DTT at 30°C for 10 min. After washing, the cells were suspended in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.2 M sorbitol and 2 mg of Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp., Japan) per 1 g of wet cell weight and incubated at 30°C for 45 min. The spheroplasts were washed once with sorbitol solution and resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The spheroplasts were disrupted with glass beads in a BeadBeater (BioSpec Products, USA). After removal of unbroken cells and cell debris by low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 45 min. The crude extract from 1 L of culture containing 120 mg of protein was applied to a 1 mL Hi-Trap Ni-agarose column (Pharmacia). After removal of nonspecifically bound proteins by washing with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, the (His)6-AMO was eluted by a FPLC-mediated 10–500 mM imidazole gradient. The fractions containing high AMO activity were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 300 mM NaCl and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and were used as the final AMO preparation. The specific activity of the pooled preparation was 3.2 U mg−1 protein, but in some fractions it reached 13.7 U mg−1.

24672387|t|Cells of the mutant strain H. polymorpha C-105 (gcr1 catX) overproducing AOX with an additional catalase inactivation mutation [, ] were grown in glucose medium [, ] and served as a source for AOX isolation. Purification of the enzyme was carried out using a two-step precipitation with ammonium sulfate (at 40 and 60% saturation) in the presence of 1 mM EDTA and 0.4 mM PMSF to inhibit proteases. At 40% saturation, the protein precipitate was discarded, and the AOX precipitate obtained at 60% saturation was collected by centrifugation. The final activity of the enzyme portions used for immobilization was 6–8 U mg−1 protein.

24672387|t|The gel beads with immobilized AMO (8.8–26.6 U g−1 of CA) were applied onto a bioreactor of the CFBR type built as a 1 × 30 cm column (1.5 g of beads in 20 mL of buffer A) connected to an air source with a known MA concentration using a scheme analogous to the one described previously by us []. The 10–100 ppm MA concentrations in air were obtained by bubbling an air flow of 7–132 mL min⁡−1 using a multichannel Ecoline peristaltic pump (Ismatec, Switzerland) through a 0.9–9 mM aqueous MA solution at 25°C. The MA concentration in the gaseous phase at the inlet was calculated, according to Henry's law, taking the Henry constant at 25°C as 1.125 Pa m3 mol−1 []. It was also measured at the inlet and at the outlet by means of adsorption of MA in analytical tubes containing XAD-7 beads covered with 10% 4-chloro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole chloride (SKC Inc., USA) and extraction of MA by tetrahydrofuran (Sigma, Israel) and analyzing the extract by HPLC (Jasco PU 1580, Japan) supplied with a UV/Vis-1578 detector (465 nm) on the Goldsil-100 C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm, 5 μm) according to OSHA Protocol no. 40 []. The MA concentration in the aqueous phase was determined by a reaction with lactose and measured by a colorimetric method [] at 545 nm with UV-Vis Cary-50 (Varian, Australia).

Two additional columns (R3 and R4) with blank gel beads served as the control. A flow of airborne MA was split into two streams. The 1st stream was bubbled through R1 and R2, where the outlet from R1 was connected to the inlet of R2. The 2nd stream was bubbled through R3 which was connected to R4. The MA and FA concentrations were tested in the gaseous phase at the outlets of all four reactors, R1–R4, and in the aqueous phase within the reactors. The FA concentration in the gaseous phase was measured with the formaldehyde gas detector (Model FP-40 Riken Keiki, Japan) and in the liquid phase by a standard photometric method using a reaction with 1% chromotropic acid [].

24672387|t|3.1. Cloning of the AMO Gene in an Expression Vector
24672387|a|

24672387|t|The AMO gene, encoding for the microbody matrix enzyme AMO (EC 1.4.3.21) from the yeast H. polymorpha, has been cloned, sequenced, and found to contain an open reading frame of 692 amino acids. The enzyme has a dimeric structure with a subunit molecular weight of 78 kDa [, ].

24672387|t|The copper-inducible system used for expression of the AMO gene was based on the pYEX-4T-1 plasmid, a shuttle expression vector developed for high-level expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in the yeast. The copper-inducible CUP1 promoter from the S. cerevisiae metallothionein gene drove the expression of the fusion cassette. pYEX-4T-1 included the Escherichia coli AmpR gene, the yeast selectable markers leu2-d (a LEU2 gene with a truncated but functional promoter), and URA3.

24672387|t|The AMO gene was expressed as a (His)6-tagged protein to facilitate its purification. The expression system was based on a modified pYEX-4T-1 vector (see Section 2). The constructed plasmid, designated as pYEX-4-AMO, expressed the (His)6-tagged-AMO protein under control of the CUP1 promoter (Figure 1).

24672387|a|

24672387|t|Yeast cells carrying the recombinant plasmid were incubated in Cu2+-containing selective medium in order to express the AMO gene. The active enzyme was accumulated in S. cerevisiae cells to a level of 0.7 U mg−1 of protein. The highest expression was obtained 6–8 h after induction. The crude extracts were prepared as described in Section 2, and (His)6-tagged AMO was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The SDS-PAGE results, that illustrate the purification, are presented in Figure 3.

24672387|t|Fractions 8–13 contained high AMO activity and were pooled and used as the final AMO preparation. The enzyme fraction with the highest AMO specific activity of 13.7 U mg−1  was used for kinetic studies.
24672387|a|

24672387|t|The specific activity of AMO increased from 4.6 to 20-fold during the course of the purification procedure, and the final yield of AMO protein was 1.6 mg L−1 culture. Previous works of others reported a specific activity of 1.1 U mg−1 protein, which was determined in the process of MA oxidation by AMO, isolated from the wild type H. polymorpha [] and 5.6 U mg−1 protein for the recombinant AMO expressed in S. cerevisiae []. These data show that the (His)6-tagged enzyme which we constructed was at least as active as the recombinant AMO described by Cai and Klinman, without any change in protein structure [].

24672387|t|The kinetic parameters of the purified (His)6-tagged AMO with a specific activity of 13.7 U mg−1 protein were studied. The K m and V max⁡ (at an enzyme concentration of 40 ng mL−1) for MA oxidation at 30°C, pH 7.0, were 0.22 ± 0.011 mM and 0.624 ± 0.050 nmol mL−1 min⁡−1, respectively, and the k cat was 40.0 ± 3.1 s−1. For comparison, AMO isolated from the wild type H. polymorpha had K m and k cat values of 0.0344 mM and 6.2 s−1, respectively, at 25°C and pH 8.0 []. The k cat/K m ratio for the (His)6-tagged enzyme was found to be approximately the same as for the wild type enzyme (182 and 180 mM−1 s−1, resp.).

24672387|t|It must be emphasized that the recombinant form of the AMO which we constructed differs considerably from the native AMO (without His-tag) previously described in the literature []. This AMO contains the (His)6-tag attached to the N-terminus which was introduced in order to facilitate its purification by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-Sepharose. The correct nucleotide sequence of the AMO-reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing, so we assume that changes in kinetic parameters can be explained by the presence of an additional “tail” in the protein structure.

24672387|t|The fundamental possibility for bioconversion of airborne MA was studied using a continuous reactor of the CFBR type that contained CA-gel beads with immobilized AMO, compared to a control system with blank CA-gel beads. An air stream obtained by bubbling various flow rates through aqueous MA solutions with concentrations calculated according to Henry's law was used in order to obtain airborne MA at the desired concentrations []. The MA concentration was monitored in the aqueous phase within the reactor and in the gaseous phase at the outlet from the reactor.

24672387|t|In the first stage, effective loading of AMO to the CA-gel was chosen. Bioconversion of MA was tested with three AMO loadings, while the remaining conditions—the 10 ppm inlet MA concentration in the air and airflow of 7 mL min⁡−1—were kept constant (Figure 4). This MA concentration was chosen because it lies between the TLV-TWA (5 ppm) and the TLV-STEL (15 ppm) values, where the former corresponds to the level permitted for average chronic exposure based on an 8 h/day and 40 h/week work schedule and the latter to acute exposure to MA for a duration of 15 min that cannot be repeated more than 4 times per day with at least 60 min between exposure periods []. The MA concentration in the aqueous phase of the bioreactor increased up to ca. 0.8 mM within the two first hours in all series. In the control experiment (CA without AMO), this MA concentration remained almost unchanged during the 10-day period, with only 10% reduction (Figure 4). The MA concentration in the bioreactors decreased after 2–5 days, depending on the AMO loading, and reached low equilibrium values: 0.035 mM at an AMO loading of 26.6 U g−1 CA, 0.06 mM at a loading of 13.3 U g−1 CA, and 0.08 mM at a loading of 8.8 U g−1 CA (Figure 4). The MA concentration in the gaseous phase at the outlet of the bioreactors did not exceed 0.3–0.5 ppm in all cases, whereas in the control experiment it was 1.3 ppm. The results of this experiment showed that although the best results were obtained with the highest AMO loading, as expected, 13.3 U g−1 CA loading of AMO on the gel may be enough for practical purposes, since 96% elimination of airborne MA was achieved. The further experiments were therefore carried out with this loading.

24672387|t|In the next experiment, the system's ability to bioconvert MA was studied using the 100 ppm MA inlet concentration. When bubbling the airborne MA at this concentration, the concentration of MA in the aqueous phase quickly increased to ca. 8 mM in both the CFBR and the control column, and in the latter case it remained high during the entire experiment. In contradistinction, the MA concentration in the CFBR with immobilized AMO dropped to 0.46 mM after 3 days and decreased further until the end of the experimental period (Figure 5(a)). The MA concentration in the gaseous phase at the outlet of the control column remained at 10–12 ppm, and at the outlet of the bioreactor it did not exceed the safety level of 0.5 ppm during the entire experimental period (Figure 5(b)).

24672387|t|The CFBR was further examined at a high airflow rate of 132 mL min⁡−1 when the AMO loading was 13.3 U g−1 CA and the inlet concentration of the airborne MA was 10 ppm (Figure 6). It can be seen that the system functioned at high efficiency in this case as well, and the whole picture was very similar to that obtained with the flow of 7 mL min⁡−1 shown in Figure 4 (the AMO-13.3 curve). MA was oxidized to a concentration of less than 0.1 mM in the aqueous phase and to no more than 0.4 ppm at the outlet of the gaseous phase (Figures 6(a) and 6(b), resp.).

24672387|t|Bioconversion of MA is known to produce FA, and, therefore, a system of two continuous CFBR, connected in series, was built for bioconversion of both the airborne MA and the produced FA (Figure 2). The first CFBR (R1) contained CA beads with immobilized AMO (13.3 U g−1 CA) and the second (R2) contained beads with immobilized AOX (6.6 U g−1 CA). Airborne MA was fed in a continuous regime at the inlet of R1 and the airflow containing the produced FA flowed from the R1 outlet into the R2 inlet. A parallel experiment was performed using the control R3 and R4 reactors which contained blank CA-gel beads. MA and FA were sampled from the aqueous phases of R1–R4 and from the gaseous phase at the outlets from all four columns. The results of the experiment are presented in Figure 7.

24672387|t|The two-step CFBR system demonstrated very high efficiency in eliminating the fed MA and the produced FA (Figure 7). As in the previous experiments, the MA concentration in the aqueous phase first increased to 0.8 mM and then decreased to ca. 0.03 mM in the equilibrium state, while the FA concentration concomitantly increased to 0.8 mM (Figure 7(a), R1(MA) and R1(FA), resp.). This fact indicates that MA was really converted into FA by the enzymatic reaction. In the control experiment, the MA concentration remained at the 0.7–0.8 mM level throughout the experiment and FA was not produced at all (Figure 7(a), R3(MA) and R3(FA), resp.). The MA and FA concentrations in the gaseous phase at the outlet from R1 were 0.4 ppm and 0.14 ppm, respectively (Figure 7(b), R1(MA) and R1(FA)), whereas, in the control experiment, the MA concentration was 6–6.5 ppm and FA was absent (Figure 7(b), R3(MA) and R3(FA)). The MA concentration in the aqueous phase of the R2 reactor was zero, and the FA concentration decreased from 0.6 mM at the beginning of the experiment to 0.09 mM in the equilibrium state (Figure 7(c), R2(MA) and R2(FA)). MA in the control R4 reactor accumulated in the aqueous phase and reached more than 0.4 mM in the equilibrium state (Figure 7(c), R4(MA)). The FA concentration was zero, as expected (Figure 7(c), R4(FA)). The outlet MA concentrations in the gaseous phase were zero and 1.6 ppm for the R2 and R4 reactors, respectively (Figure 7(d), R2(MA) and R4(MA)). The outlet FA concentration was zero in both cases (data not shown). The data presented in Figure 7 clearly show that airborne MA was bioconverted into FA in the R1 reactor and that the produced FA was degraded in the R2 reactor, whereas in the control system MA was not oxidized and, accordingly, FA was not produced at all. Simple trapping of airborne MA by two columns did not lead to its elimination and caused accumulation of MA in the aqueous phase of the R3 and R4 as well as MA exhaust in the gaseous phase.

24672387|t|Several methods have been previously proposed for removal of MA from indoor air. Chou and Shiu[] reported bioconversion of MA on biofilters arranged in three stages, which contained microorganisms from activated sludge that was obtained from a food-processing wastewater plant. The authors showed that the influent airborne MA, with an input concentration of 100 ppm, was hydrolyzed to ammonia, about a third of the ammonia nitrogen was nitrified to nitrate, and a third was converted into organic or cell nitrogen. Ho's group [] developed a biofilter based on granular activated carbon coated with immobilized Paracoccus sp. CP2 for elimination of 10–250 ppm trimethylamine (TMA), dimethylamine (DMA), and MA. The system effectively treated MA (>93%), DMA (>90%), and TMA (>85%). The coimmobilized Paracoccus sp. CP2 and Arthrobacter sp. CP1 system was used to achieve complete degradation of TMA and to reduce NH3 emission.

24672387|t|Methods for the bioconversion of MA traditionally compete with chemical methods of degradation. Kachina et al. [] investigated continuous photocatalytic MA oxidation. The authors used titanium dioxide illuminated with UV light at 365 nm as a catalyst. The oxidation process was efficient and the TiO2 catalyst showed no deactivation. However, the authors found nitrogen and nitrous oxides among the products of the MA oxidation, in addition to ammonia, which overshadowed the advantages of the method.

24672387|t|Besides destructive methods for the elimination of airborne MA, methods of physical adsorption of airborne MA on several carbon materials were also studied []. Despite a high adsorption efficiency, physical adsorption does not lead to degradation of MA and is therefore less preferable than chemical or biological conversion methods.

24672387|a|

24672387|t|A recombinant S. cerevisiae yeast overproducing AMO from the thermotolerant yeast H. polymorpha was constructed. The novel (His)6-tagged enzyme was purified from the cell-free extract of the recombinant strain by metal-affinity chromatography and characterized electrophoretically and kinetically. The enzyme that was immobilized in CA beads demonstrated a high capability for eliminating airborne MA in a continuous regime, when employed in a two-step CFBR designed for bioconversion of airborne MA and the produced FA.

24742127|a|

24742127|t|Chemotherapeutic treatment results in chronic pain in an estimated 30-40 percent of patients. Limited and often ineffective treatments make the need for new therapeutics an urgent one. We compared the effects of prophylactic cannabinoids as a preventative strategy for suppressing development of paclitaxel-induced nociception. The mixed CB1/CB2 agonist WIN55,212-2 was compared with the cannabilactone CB2-selective agonist AM1710, administered subcutaneously (s.c.), via osmotic mini pumps before, during, and after paclitaxel treatment. Pharmacological specificity was assessed using CB1 (AM251) and CB2 (AM630) antagonists. The impact of chronic drug infusion on transcriptional regulation of mRNA markers of astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (CD11b) and cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2) was assessed in lumbar spinal cords of paclitaxel and vehicle-treated rats.

24742127|t|Both WIN55,212-2 and AM1710 blocked the development of paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia; anti-allodynic efficacy persisted for approximately two to three weeks following cessation of drug delivery. WIN55,212-2 (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) suppressed the development of both paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia. WIN55,212-2-mediated suppression of mechanical hypersensitivity was dominated by CB1 activation whereas suppression of cold allodynia was relatively insensitive to blockade by either CB1 (AM251; 3 mg/kg/day s.c.) or CB2 (AM630; 3 mg/kg/day s.c.) antagonists. AM1710 (0.032 and 3.2 mg/kg /day) suppressed development of mechanical allodynia whereas only the highest dose (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) suppressed cold allodynia. Anti-allodynic effects of AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) were mediated by CB2. Anti-allodynic efficacy of AM1710 outlasted that produced by chronic WIN55,212-2 infusion. mRNA expression levels of the astrocytic marker GFAP was marginally increased by paclitaxel treatment whereas expression of the microglial marker CD11b was unchanged. Both WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) and AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) increased CB1 and CB2 mRNA expression in lumbar spinal cord of paclitaxel-treated rats in a manner blocked by AM630.

24742127|t|Conclusions and implications
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Cannabinoids block development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy and protect against neuropathic allodynia following cessation of drug delivery. Chronic treatment with both mixed CB1/CB2 and CB2 selective cannabinoids increased mRNA expression of cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2) in a CB2-dependent fashion. Our results support the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for suppressing chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in humans.

24742127|t|Background
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Cannabinoids attenuate or, in some cases, prevent pain associated with surgery [1], inflammation [2], internal organs [3], and neuropathies (for review see [4]). Neuropathic pain is associated with abnormal changes in the peripheral and/or central nervous system resulting in non-adaptive, chronic pain. Clinical manifestations of neuropathic pain are notoriously unresponsive to traditional analgesics. Chemotherapeutic treatment with antineoplastic agents, while effective at eliminating harmful malignancies, is also associated with severe side effects. Of these side effects, emesis, alopecia, and myelosuppression have received the spotlight; however, a new front runner has recently emerged. Neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapeutic treatment is dose-limiting and a major factor influencing discontinuation of treatment [5,6]. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is positively correlated with cumulative chemotherapeutic dose [7], and affected patients are more likely to experience other neuropathies [8]. An aging US population, coupled with diagnostic and medical advances in cancer treatment, means that more cancer survivors will be impacted by, and living longer with, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Thus, identification of prophylactic treatments that block development of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy represents an urgent medical need.

24742127|t|Chemotherapeutic agents are divided into three mechanistically distinct classes. These classes include the vinca alkaloids, platinum-derived agents, and taxanes. Taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel) produce antineoplastic effects by stabilizing microtubules through binding to β-tubulin, thereby disrupting normal cell mitosis and triggering the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [9]. Paclitaxel is a preferred agent for treatment of ovarian, breast, and lung cancers; however, a high percentage of patients experience neuropathic pain – a type of pain poorly treated with available drugs [10]. Mechanisms underlying development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy remain incompletely understood but may involve changes in glial activation [11,12].

24742127|t|Cannabinoid agonists suppress paclitaxel-induced neuropathic nociception in animal models through activation of both CB1[13] and CB2[14-16] cannabinoid receptor subtypes. Our laboratory first demonstrated CB2 receptor-mediated suppression of neuropathic allodynia induced by chemotherapeutic treatment with vincristine [17], paclitaxel [14,18], and cisplatin [15]. Previous prophylactic treatment strategies with cannabinoids in a traumatic nerve injury model demonstrated that pre-emptive cannabinoids produced greater antinociception relative to post-injury treatment [19]. Here we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of prophylactically administered WIN55,212-2, a mixed cannabinoid (CB1/CB2) agonist, and AM1710, a CB2-preferring agonist, on the development of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in the paclitaxel model. Osmotic mini pumps were used to continuously infuse cannabinoids before, during, and after paclitaxel treatment, to emulate a prophylactic analgesic strategy achievable in clinical oncology settings. We compared development of mechanical and cold allodynia, both common clinical manifestations of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy [10,20]. We hypothesized that chronic prophylactic cannabinoid infusion would produce sustained suppression of paclitaxel-induced behavioral sensitization to mechanical and cold stimulation. Furthermore, we evaluated whether long-term transcriptional changes in mRNA markers of astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (CD11b), and cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2) would accompany long lasting anti-allodynic efficacy of cannabinoids.

24742127|t|Paclitaxel-treated animals showed reduced sensitivity to heat on day 6 (F1,10 = 20.745, P < 0.01; Figure 1a), but not at subsequent time points (P > 0.16), while the same animals developed hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation (i.e., mechanical allodynia) (F1,10 = 6.191, P < 0.05; Figure 1b). Based upon these results, animals implanted with osmotic pumps were evaluated for responsiveness to mechanical and cold stimulation only.

24742127|t|Osmotic mini pump dispersion volume was calculated by subtracting the fill volume from the residual volume in the pump reservoir following pump removal (day 22). The pump dispersion volume differed between groups in which drugs were dissolved in the DMSO:PEG400 vehicle (F19,180 = 2.213, P < 0.01). Post-hoc analysis revealed that pump dispersion volume for the Taxol-WIN55,212-2 (1 mg/kg/day s.c.) group was less than half (< 43%) of other groups dissolved in the same vehicle. No other differences were found. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds did not differ between either the right or left paw on any given day for animals tested up to 20 (P > 0.98) or 50 (P > 0.71) days post-chemotherapy treatment; therefore, withdrawal thresholds are presented as the mean of duplicate measurements, averaged across paws. Two dependent measures for cold allodynia were evaluated: percentage of paw withdrawals and duration of paw withdrawal. Duration of paw withdrawal in response to topical acetone application is a reported measure of cold allodynia [21-23]. However, we found this measure highly variable in rat subjects (data not shown) and consequently only the percentage of paw withdrawals is reported here. Percentage of paw withdrawals to cold stimulation did not differ between either paw on any given day for animals tested up to 21 (P > 0.33) or 51 (P > 0.82) days post-paclitaxel; therefore, the percentage of paw withdrawals is presented as the mean of duplicate measurements averaged across paws.

24742127|t|To control for any possible effects associated with the vehicle used to dissolve cannabinoids (DMSO:PEG 400 in a 1:1 ratio), a subset of animals treated with either paclitaxel or cremophor received saline in their osmotic mini pumps. No differences were detected between paclitaxel-treated animals that received vehicle (DMSO:PEG 400; n = 14) or saline (n = 4) in any behavioral parameter assessed (i.e., mechanical threshold, cold withdrawal frequency, and locomotor activity). Similarly, no differences were noted between cremophor-treated animals receiving chronic infusions of vehicle (DMSO:PEG 400; n = 8) or saline (n = 4). Therefore, vehicle and saline groups were combined for each condition and are referred to as the Taxol-vehicle group and cremophor-vehicle group, respectively.

The middle and low doses of WIN55,212-2 (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg/day s.c.) blocked development of cold allodynia in paclitaxel-treated animals (F4,55 = 11.428, P < 0.001, P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 2e) for the duration of drug delivery. The high dose of WIN55,212-2 (1 mg/kg/day s.c.) failed to fully suppress development of paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia. However, animals in this group nonetheless showed protection against cold allodynia relative to paclitaxel-vehicle treated animals at some observation intervals (i.e., days 11 and 21; P < 0.001).

Both WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) and AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) elevated mechanical withdrawal thresholds in paclitaxel-treated relative to cremophor-vehicle treated rats (F5,66 = 66.292, P < 0.001; P < 0.01 for each comparison; Figure 4a) from day 4 through the final test day corresponding to drug delivery (F60,792 = 4.888, P < 0.001; P < 0.05 for each comparison). WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) normalized mechanical withdrawal thresholds in paclitaxel-treated groups with two exceptions; a transient drop in threshold on days 8 and 16 was observed relative to the cremophor-vehicle group (P < 0.05 for each comparison). By contrast, AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) effectively normalized mechanical thresholds in paclitaxel-treated animals to those observed in the cremophor-vehicle group. WIN55,212-2 and AM1710 suppressed development of paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia with similar efficacy (F5,66 = 12.365, P < 0.001; P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 4b) over the time course (F25,330 = 6.892, P < 0.001). Neither agonist produced antinociception to either mechanical or cold stimulation in animals that received cremophor vehicle in lieu of paclitaxel.

24742127|t|Mechanical allodynia
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Paclitaxel produced long-lasting mechanical allodynia in rats receiving infusions of vehicle relative to cremophor-vehicle treatment (F75,500 = 2.218, P < 0.01, P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 6a); these effects persisted until the final test day (day 50). We next examined the protective effects of WIN55,212-2 and AM1710 following cessation of drug delivery (Figure 6). WIN55,212-2 (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg/day s.c., delivered from days -6 through 22) blocked the development of paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia (F3,20 = 48.189, P < 0.001; Figure 6a) for approximately 11 days following cessation of drug delivery (F75,500 = 2.218, P < 0.01, P < 0.05 for each comparison). Similarly, AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) protected against development of paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia for 17 days following drug removal (i.e., day 38); (F3,22 = 41.754, P < 0.001, P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 6b). The low dose of AM1710 (0.032 mg/kg/day s.c.) also increased paw withdrawal thresholds up to 17 days following drug removal (P < 0.01 for each comparison); however, thresholds in this group failed to differ from the paclitaxel-vehicle condition on several days (days 28 and 34), suggesting that mechanical allodynia was beginning to develop. The high dose of AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) produced longer protection (F75,550 = 2.584, P < 0.001, P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 6c) against mechanical allodynia development compared to WIN55,212-2 (F3,22 = 69.008, P < 0.001).

24742127|t|Cold allodynia
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Paclitaxel increased responsiveness to acetone in animals receiving infusions of vehicle throughout the time course (F30,200 = 3.784, P < 0.001; P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 7a). WIN55,212-2 (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg/day s.c.) suppressed development of paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia (F3,20 = 12.367, P < 0.001; Figure 7a) up to 12 (day 33) and 18 days (day 39) following cessation of analgesic drug delivery, respectively. AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) suppressed development and postponed emergence of cold allodynia (F3,22 = 16.132, P < 0.001; P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 7b) for 18 days following cessation of drug delivery (F30,220 = 4.709, P < 0.001; P < 0.05 for each comparison). The low dose of AM1710 (0.032 mg/kg/day s.c.) suppressed cold allodynia through day 33 (P < 0.05 for each comparisons), indicating a shorter duration of protection relative to the high dose. Both AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) and WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) protected against development of paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia (F3,22 = 13.216, P < 0.001, P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 7c) over the time course (F30,220 = 4.439, P < 0.001) The high dose of AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) delayed the emergence of paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia longer than WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.).

24742127|a|

24742127|t|To understand the potential molecular targets mediating the suppression of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy by WIN55212-2 and AM1710 after cessation of drug delivery, we examined the mRNA levels of markers of astrocytes and microglia as well as CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNA levels. We used RT-PCR to measure the mRNA levels of the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglial marker cluster of differentiation molecule 11B (CD11b) (Figure 10a). RT-PCR analysis revealed a trend towards increased expression of GFAP (P = 0.059, one-tailed planned comparison t-test; Figure 10a) in lumbar spinal cords of paclitaxel- relative to cremophor-vehicle controls on day 22. No alterations in CD11b mRNA levels were observed at the same time point (P = 0.413). Neither infusion of WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) nor AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) altered GFAP or CD11b mRNA expression in paclitaxel-treated animals (day 22; P > 0.122 for each comparison; Figure 10a). Cannabinoid receptor activation by chronic agonists may produce compensatory changes in receptor levels [16], and pathological pain may alter expression levels of cannabinoid receptors [24-27]. We, therefore, measured levels of CB1 and CB2 mRNA after various treatments (Figure 10b). Both WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) and AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) increased mRNA expression of cannabinoid CB1 (F5,23 = 9.527, P < 0.001) and CB2 (F5,23 = 15.117, P < 0.001; Figure 10b) receptors in lumbar spinal cord. These agonist-induced increases in CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNA expression were blocked in animals that received concurrent administration of AM630 (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) (P < 0.05 for each comparison).

24742127|a|

24742127|t|Prophylactic administration of cannabinoid analgesics protected against the development of paclitaxel-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation in a preventative fashion. Both the mixed cannabinoid CB1/CB2 agonist WIN55,212-2 and the CB2 agonist AM1710 blocked development of paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia. Strikingly, the protective prophylactic effects of both WIN55,212-2 and AM1710 were preserved following drug removal, with the CB2-specific agonist providing a longer duration of protection against allodynia development for both mechanical and cold modalities. In our study, paclitaxel produced marked mechanical and cold allodynia but not heat hyperalgesia, as observed in a different dosing paradigm (cumulative dose: 4 mg/kg i.p.) [28]. In vehicle (cremophor) treated controls, the most efficacious doses of these cannabinoids also failed to produce antinociception, suggesting that cannabinoids were anti-allodynic rather than analgesic under these conditions.

24742127|t|WIN55,212-2 (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg/day s.c.) suppressed the development of paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia both during drug delivery and following drug removal. Our study is the first to evaluate duration of efficacy, dose response, and pharmacological specificity of prophylactic WIN55,212-2. Anti-allodynic effects of both doses were present 11 (mechanical) and 12 (cold) days following cessation of drug delivery. WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.)-induced suppression of mechanical hypersensitivity was dominated by CB1 receptor activation because anti-allodynic efficacy was blocked by AM251. The CB2 antagonist AM630 (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) prevented anti-allodynic efficacy of AM1710 but failed to eliminate WIN55,212-2-mediated anti-allodynia. Interestingly, blockade of WIN55,212-2-mediated anti-allodynic effects to cold was not achieved with either antagonist. However, the same antagonist infusion conditions blocked either WIN55,212-2 mediated suppression of mechanical allodynia (AM251) or AM1710-mediated suppression of both mechanical and cold allodynia (AM630), documenting efficacy of antagonist infusion conditions employed here.

24742127|t|We could find only one report of WIN55,212-2-induced suppression of cold allodynia in a neuropathic pain model (spinal nerve ligation) where pharmacological specificity was assessed; anti-allodynic effects were blocked by a CB1 (SR141716a) but not a CB2 (SR144528) antagonist [29]. Blockade of both CB1 and CB2 receptors may be required to fully prevent anti-allodynic effects of WIN55,212-2. However, limitations in compound solubility prohibited co-administration of both antagonists in one pump.

24742127|t|Few studies have examined cannabinoid-mediated modulation of cold allodynia and/or its development in neuropathic pain models and more work is necessary to determine functional contributions of each receptor. WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) treatment increased both CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNA expression within lumbar spinal cord of paclitaxel-treated animals on day 22, an effect blocked by concurrent AM630 (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) treatment. WIN55,212-2 also ameliorates established paclitaxel-induced nociception [13] and repeated administration (1 mg/kg i.p. × 14 days) prevents nociception development during drug delivery [11].

24742127|t|Strikingly, doses of AM1710 as low as 0.032 mg/kg/day blocked the development of paclitaxel-induced allodynia in our study and these effects were preserved for approximately three weeks following cessation of drug delivery. Prophylactic AM1710 treatment suppressed development of both paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia, with high (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) and low (0.032 mg/kg/day s.c.) doses exhibiting the greatest efficacy. A similar U-shaped dose response curve was obtained for thermal antinociception (plantar test) in naive animals without observable CB1-mediated side effects [30].

24742127|t|Protective effects of prophylactic AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) lasted 17–18 days following drug removal and outlasted the anti-allodynic effects of WIN55,212-2. Unlike WIN55,212-2, anti-allodynic effects of AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) were mediated by CB2 activation only. Our lab previously demonstrated AM1710-mediated amelioration of allodynia during the maintenance phase of paclitaxel-induced nociception (day 20) following acute administration [15]. Four CB2 agonists have been shown to ameliorate established paclitaxel-induced neuropathic nociception [14,15,31,32]. Notably, repeated administration of the CB2 agonist MDA7 (15 mg/kg i.p. × 14 days) 15 min prior to behavioral evaluations also blocked paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia through a CB2 mechanism during the phase of drug delivery (i.e., behavioral effects blocked by AM630 and absent in CB2-/- mice) [16].

24742127|t|Long-term alterations in lumbar spinal cord CB1 or CB2 mRNA expression (day 22) were not induced by paclitaxel- relative to cremophor-treatment in our study by RT-PCR. However, prophylactic AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) increased both CB1 and CB2 mRNA expression, an effect blocked by concurrent AM630 (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) administration. By contrast, MDA7 (15 mg/kg i.p. × 14 days) has been reported to normalize paclitaxel-induced increases in lumbar spinal cord CB2 receptor protein [16]. Differences in paclitaxel dosing (cumulative dose: 8 vs. 4 mg/kg i.p.), CB2 agonist (AM1710 vs. MDA7), route of administration (mini pump vs. once-daily injections), or protein vs. mRNA analysis could help account for these differential findings.

Interestingly, higher doses of WIN55,212-2 (1–2 mg/kg/day i.p.) failed to attenuate anorexia or weight loss in animals treated with cisplatin [34].

Thus, chronic infusion of either the mixed CB1/CB2 agonist or the CB2 agonist was unlikely to nonselectively activate CB1 receptors; no evidence for hypoactivity [35], a cardinal sign of CB1 activation, was observed. These findings are consistent with the results documenting absence of cardinal signs of CB1 receptor activation following acute administration of AM1710 [30].

24742127|t|Glial activation mediates alterations in synaptic transmission for a number of excitatory and inhibitory mediators known to be important for the maintenance of neuropathic pain states [36]. Because of the prolonged suppression of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy after removal of cannabinoid agonists, we chose to analyze transcriptional changes in markers of glial activation. GFAP mRNA expression in lumbar spinal cord on day 22 (i.e., approximately 24 h after the pump ceased to release drug) showed a trend toward increased expression in paclitaxel- relative to cremophor-treated controls, while no change in CD11b expression was observed. Increases in astrocytic activation (GFAP) with no corresponding changes in microglial activation (OX42, Iba1, and phosphorylated p38) were also recently observed with the same paclitaxel-induced neuropathy dosing protocol used here [12]. In another study, paclitaxel failed to produce microglial activation (% of cremophor-control staining) on day 27 post-treatment [37]. By contrast, MDA7 and WIN55,212-2 suppressed paclitaxel-induced glial activation (on days 28 and 29 post-treatment, respectively) when immunohistochemical staining for astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (CD11b) was compared with naive animals [11], and it remains unclear whether vehicle or cremophor administration alters glial activation [16]. Cremophor can produce side effects in both clinical use and animal models [38], and assumptions that it is inert are not appropriate.

24742127|t|Prophylactic treatment with either a mixed CB1/CB2 agonist or a CB2 agonist, while failing to produce robust alterations in lumbar spinal cord glial expression, increased CB1 and CB2 mRNA expression. This effect was blocked by CB2 receptor blockade. Upregulation of endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors is associated with several neuropathic pain models (for review see [39]). However, to our knowledge, very few, if any, studies have evaluated alterations following prophylactic cannabinoid treatment. Increased receptor densities could increase the potency or efficacy of prophylactic cannabinoids in this model. More work is necessary to determine whether changes in CB1 and CB2 mRNA levels observed here are also associated with changes in receptor protein. Alternatively, increased CB1 and CB2 mRNA expression could reflect compensatory changes in transcription following chronic agonist-induced downregulation of receptors. More work is necessary to fully characterize the duration of these effects and their therapeutic implications.

24742127|t|Conclusion
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Prophylactic treatment has been tested as a preventive strategy for paclitaxel-induced neuropathic nociception with multiple drugs (for review see [41]). Here, we demonstrate that cannabinoid agonists with different mechanisms of action prevent development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic nociception during treatment and approximately two to three weeks following cessation of drug delivery. Paclitaxel treatment marginally altered long-term GFAP mRNA expression in lumbar spinal cord and this expression was unaffected by prophylactic cannabinoids, whereas CD11b mRNA expression was unchanged. Prophylactic treatment with either WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day s.c.) or AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day s.c.) in paclitaxel animals did, however, increase both CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNA expression, an effect blocked by concurrent AM630 (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) administration. Some inroads have been made toward discovering mechanisms for cannabinoid-mediated suppression of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy, but more work is necessary to determine the scope and time course of this complex interaction. Our study suggests that further clinical cannabinoid trials [40] for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are warranted.

24742127|t|Animals were allowed a minimum of one week habituation prior to beginning the study. Animals were single housed and maintained in a temperature (70-72 °F ± 4 °F) and humidity (30-70%) controlled facility on a 12 hour light cycle (lights on: 07:00 and lights off: 19:00). Food and water was available ad libitum. Following the initial pilot study (n = 17), all animals with osmotic mini pumps were allowed nyla bones (BioServe; Frenchtown, NJ) due to the study duration. Corn cob bedding containing metabolized paclitaxel was treated as chemical hazard waste and disposed of according to appropriate institutional guidelines.

24742127|t|Paclitaxel (Taxol) was obtained from Tecoland (Edison, NJ). Polyethylene Glycol 400 (PEG 400) was purchased from VWR International (West Chester, PA). Acetone was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Cremophor EL, Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), and WIN55,212-2 ((R)-(+)-[2,3-Dihydro-5-methyl-3[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate salt) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). AM1710 (3-(1’,1’-dimethylheptyl)-1-hydroxy-9-methoxy-6H-benzo[c]chromene-6-one), AM251 (N-(Piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide), and AM630 (6-Iodo-2-methyl-1-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl](4-methoxyphenyl)methanone (Iodopravadoline) were synthesized in the Center for Drug Discovery by one of the authors (by GT, VKV, and AZ respectively). Rat subjects received paclitaxel dissolved as previously described [42], administered in a volume of 1 ml/kg. Briefly, paclitaxel was dissolved in a 1:2 ratio of working stock (1:1 ratio of cremophor EL and 95% ethanol) to saline. AM1710, WIN55,212-2, AM251, and AM630 were dissolved in a vehicle of DMSO:PEG 400 in a 1:1 ratio. The selected vehicle was the most compatible for dissolving cannabinoids to be used in Alzet osmotic mini pumps with no reported adverse side effects [43-45].

24742127|t|General experimental methods
24742127|a|

24742127|t|In an initial study, animals were evaluated for development of paclitaxel-induced behavioral sensitization to mechanical and heat stimulation. Responsiveness to different modalities of cutaneous stimulation was assessed on alternate days to avoid sensitization. All subsequent studies used animals surgically implanted with osmotic mini pumps. Baseline assessments of withdrawal thresholds to mechanical and cold (acetone drops) stimulation of the hind paw occurred 48 h (day -8) and 24 h (day -7) prior to surgery, respectively. Osmotic mini pumps (Alzet model 2ML4, Cupertino, CA) were implanted subcutaneously through an incision between the scapulae. Responsiveness to mechanical and cold stimulation was reassessed post-surgery (i.e., after pump implantation but within 48 h prior to initiation (on day 0) of paclitaxel dosing). Animals were weighed on all testing and surgical/sacrifice dates. A subset of animals was sacrificed via live decapitation (day 22) to extract lumbar spinal cords. Certain groups (e.g., antagonist alone conditions, submaximal doses of agonists, cremophor-agonist groups) were only tested through day 22. Osmotic mini pumps were removed in all remaining animals (day 22), and following a short recovery period, responses to mechanical and cold stimulation were reassessed until day 51 post-paclitaxel.

24742127|t|Drug doses were estimated based on the peak osmotic mini pump performance reported by the manufacturer (2.5 μl/hr) and an average rat weight of 375 grams. A small percentage of animals (4.2%) presented with edema around the pump site (seromas). Alzet reports this side effect in < 5% of animals. Treatment for these animals was supervised by the attending veterinarian and consisted of draining fluid every 3 days, or as needed. Six animals (3.6%) were re-sutured following surgery. One of the six animals developed an infection and was treated (from days 16–22) with daily injections of an antibiotic (Enrofloxacin 4.5 mg/ml, 0.4 cc s.c., 2× daily) and sterile water (1 cc s.c., 1× daily) as prescribed by the staff veterinarian. One animal died during the first paclitaxel injection and this animal was excluded from all analyses.

24742127|t|Surgical implantation and removal of osmotic mini pumps
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Osmotic mini pumps were implanted under isoflurane anesthesia (Isoflo®, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). The osmotic mini pump was inserted through a surgical incision made between the scapulae; incisions were sutured closed. In the instances where two pumps were implanted (i.e., agonist and antagonist co-administration conditions), pumps were placed in the same pocket. The Alzet model 2ML4 pump has an approximate 2 ml reservoir that releases a preloaded drug or vehicle at a rate of 2.5 ul/hr for approximately 28 days. The pump begins to release the preloaded drug approximately 4–6 hours after implantation; the flow rate is not subject to variations in body temperature. Osmotic mini pumps were weighed before and after being filled with drug or vehicle. The difference of these two values provided an approximate pump fill volume. The animals were given three days (days -5 through -3) to recover from surgery before testing resumed. Animals were either sacrificed or underwent surgery on day 22 to remove pumps; this time point corresponds to the 29th day following pump implantation, at which point the pump should have released its contents. Following pump removal, the residual pump volume was estimated by withdrawing the remaining fluid within the pump reservoir. Animals that underwent surgical removal of osmotic mini pumps were allowed three days of recovery (days 23–25) prior to resumption of behavioral testing.

24742127|t|Assessment of paw withdrawal latencies to heat stimulation
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Paw withdrawal latencies to radiant heat were measured in duplicate for each paw using the Hargreaves test [46] and a commercially available plantar stimulation unit (IITC model 336; Woodland Hills, CA). Rats were placed underneath inverted plastic cages positioned on an elevated glass platform and allowed a minimum of 20 min to habituate prior to testing. Radiant heat was presented to the hind paw midplantar region through the floor of the glass platform. The intensity of the heat source was adjusted such that an average baseline latency of approximately 20 sec was achieved [47]. Stimulation was terminated upon paw withdrawal or after 40 s to prevent tissue damage. Approximately 4 minute interstimulation intervals were allowed between tests. Thermal withdrawal latencies were evaluated before (day 0) and on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 following initiation of paclitaxel dosing. The same animals were tested for the development of mechanical allodynia. Baseline responses to mechanical stimulation (methodology below) were measured (on day 0) before baseline responses to thermal stimulation. A minimum of 1 hour was allowed to elapse between baseline measurements.

24742127|t|Assessment of mechanical withdrawal thresholds
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were assessed using a digital Electrovonfrey Anesthesiometer (IITC model Alemo 2390–5; Woodland Hills, CA) equipped with a rigid tip. Rats were placed underneath inverted plastic cages positioned on an elevated mesh platform and allowed a 20 min habituation period prior to testing. Stimulation was applied to the hind paw midplantar region through the floor of a mesh platform. Mechanical stimulation was terminated upon paw withdrawal; consequently, no upper threshold limit was set for termination of a trial. Two thresholds were taken for each paw. Approximately 2 minute interstimulation intervals were allowed between tests. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured on days 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 for animals that did not receive osmotic mini pumps (Figure 1). Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured every 2–6 days (i.e., days -8, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20) for all animals that received osmotic mini pumps. A subset of osmotic mini pump animals were tested until day 50 (testing continued with the following schedule: days 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, and 50).

24742127|t|Assessment of cold allodynia
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Cold allodynia was assessed using acetone drops applied to the hind paw midplantar surface as previously described [15,48]. Rats were placed underneath inverted plastic cages positioned on an elevated mesh platform and allowed a 20 min habituation period prior to testing. Acetone was loaded into a one cc syringe barrel with no needle tip. One drop of acetone (approximately 20 μl) was applied through the mesh platform onto the hind paw midplantar surface. Care was taken to gently apply the bubble of acetone to the skin without inducing mechanical stimulation by syringe barrel contact with the paw.

24742127|t|Paw withdrawal was recorded as a binary response (presence or absence) and was frequently accompanied by nocifensive behaviors (e.g., rapid flicking of the paw, chattering, biting, and/or licking of the paw). These nocifensive behaviors were recorded as duration of acetone response. Five measurements were taken for each paw. Testing order alternated between paws (i.e., right, left). No cut-off latency was enforced. Approximately 2 min interstimulation intervals were allowed between testing of right and left paws. A minimum interstimulation interval of 5 min was allowed between testing each pair of paws (right and left). Cold allodynia testing took place on days -7, -1, 5, 11, 17 and 21 for all animals with osmotic mini pumps. Five days were allowed between assessments of cold allodynia to avoid hypersensitivity with one exception. Animals were tested on day 21 because osmotic mini pumps would purportedly still be releasing drug (i.e., 28 days following pump implantation). A subset of animals was tested to day 51 (i.e., testing for these animals continued with the following schedule: days 27, 33, 39, 45, and 51).

24742127|t|Total distance traveled (cm) was assessed using an activity monitor chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA) measuring 40.64 cm3. The apparatus was housed in a darkened room and red light was used to provide illumination. Tracking beams were positioned 2.54 cm apart giving 1.27 cm in spatial resolution. Activity was automatically measured by computerized analysis of photobeam interrupts (TruScan 2.0; Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA). Animals were allowed a minimum of 15 minutes to habituate to the room prior to being placed undisturbed in the activity meter for 15 min. Chlorhexidine was used to clean the activity meter after each animal. Activity meter assessment took place both during (day 19) and following termination (day 31) of drug delivery in a subset of animals that received chronic infusions.

24742127|t|Quantification of lumbar spinal cord mRNA
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Real time RT-PCR was used to quantify mRNA levels in lumbar spinal cords removed from animals sacrificed on day 22. Methods are described previously [49]. RNA from paclitaxel-treated animals that received vehicle, WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day), WIN55,212-2 (0.5 mg/kg/day) + AM630 (3 mg/kg/day), AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day), AM1710 (3.2 mg/kg/day) + AM630 (3 mg/kg/day), or from cremophor-vehicle-treated animals (n = 4 per group) were extracted using a TRIzol (Invitrogen)/RNeasy (Qiagen) hybrid protocol according to manufacturer’s instructions. Purified RNA from each sample was then treated with DNase 1. Expression levels of GFAP, CD11b, CB1, and CB2 mRNAs were quantified using one step RT-PCR in a Mastercycler ep realplex RT-PCR machine (Eppendorf North America Inc., Hauppauge, NY) using PowerSYBR green PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as internal standard to normalize mRNA levels. Primers used were as follows: rat GAPDH (sense: 5′-ATGACTCTACCCACGGCAAG-3′, anti-sense: 5′CATACTCTGCACCAGCATCTC-3′); rat GFAP (sense: 5′-GAGTCCACAACCATCCTTCTGAG-3′, anti-sense: 5′-ACACCAGGCTGCTTGAACAC-3′); rat CD11b (sense: 5′-CTGGGAGATGTGAATGGAG-3′, anti-sense: 5′-ACTGATGCTGGCTACTGATG-3′); rat CB1 (sense: 5′-CTACTGGTGCTGTGTGTCATC-3′ and anti-sense: 5′-GCTGTCTTTACGGTGGAATAC-3′); rat CB2 (sense: 5′-GCAGCCTGCTGCTGACCGCTG-3′, anti-sense: 5′-TGCTTTCCAGAGGACATACCC-3′).

24742127|t|Statistical analyses
24742127|a|

24742127|t|Percentage of paw withdrawals from acetone application to the hind paws was calculated using the following formula: ((Total number of paw withdrawals) * 100)/10. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures, one-way ANOVA, or planned comparison t-test as appropriate. SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Incorporated, Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software was employed. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to all repeated factors where the epsilon value from Mauchly’s Test of Sphericity was < 0.75 and significance level was P < 0.05. Degrees of freedom reported for interaction terms of repeated factors are uncorrected values in cases where the Greenhouse-Geisser correction factor was applied. Post-hoc comparisons between the primary control group (paclitaxel-vehicle) and other experimental groups were performed using the Dunnett test (2-sided). Post-hoc comparisons between different experimental groups were also performed to assess dose–response relationships and pharmacological specificity using the Tukey test. Levene’s test for homoscedasticity was applied to all planned comparison t-tests. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

24736877|t|The present study evaluated the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, on irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and elucidated its mechanism of action. A rat model of irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis was generated using a 60Co irradiator and a dose of 22 Gy. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with EGCG (25 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (DEX; 5 mg/kg) daily for 30 days. Mortality rates and lung index values were calculated. The severity of fibrosis was evaluated by assaying the hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents of pulmonary and lung tissue sections post-irradiation. Alveolitis and fibrosis scores were obtained from semi-quantitative analyses of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome lung section staining, respectively. The serum levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were also measured. Surfactant protein-B (SPB) and α-SMA expression patterns were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and the protein levels of nuclear transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and its associated antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase-1 enzyme (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1) were examined via western blot analysis. Treatment with EGCG, but not DEX, reduced mortality rates and lung index scores, improved histological changes in the lung, reduced collagen depositions, reduced MDA content, enhanced SOD activity, inhibited (myo)fibroblast proliferation, protected alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells, and regulated serum levels of TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Treatment with EGCG, but not DEX, activated Nrf-2 and its downstream antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1. Taken together, these results showed that EGCG treatment significantly inhibits irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, the results suggested promising clinical EGCG therapies to treat this disorder.

24736877|t|Introduction
24736877|a|

24736877|t|Irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis is a major complication associated with total body irradiation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, nuclear accidents, and thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer, breast cancer, thymoma, and lymphoma (1,2). This complication develops ~6 months to several years after radiation exposure in humans and 100–120 days post-irradiation in the C57BL/6J mouse model (2). Recent clinical data have demonstrated that the incidence of irradiation-related pulmonary injury among patients with cancer who received radiotherapy ranged from 20.3% to 36.9% (3–6). The current clinical treatment for pulmonary fibrosis primarily involves drugs such as steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and immunosuppressive agents. These drugs can decrease acute pneumonitis for 2–3 months after irradiation, but they cannot effectively mitigate fibrosis (2). In addition, immunosuppressive agents can cause serious side-effects, including death.

24736877|t|Oxidative stress begins at radiation exposure and is sustained throughout the disease’s progression, presumably through the radiation-induced activation of oxidant-generating enzymes, mitochondrial leakage, and the activation of the respiratory burst in the phagocytic cells that infiltrate damaged tissue (7). Therefore, antioxidant treatment strategies are being developed to treat irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural antioxidant derived from green tea that has attracted particular attention and recognition for its potential applications in the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases (8). EGCG is the primary component of tea polyphenols, and it has shown a wide range of biological activities and pharmacological effects in vitro and in vivo, including antioxidant, anti-free radical, anti-mutagenic, and antitumor effects (9). EGCG inhibits chemical-induced lung fibrosis (10–13) and liver fibrosis (14). However, irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and acute chemical-induced lung injury are not identical, particularly with respect to their pathogeneses. As yet, no study has examined the efficacy or mechanism of action of EGCG with regard to preventing or treating irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

24736877|t|To counteract the oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), lung cells activate a wide variety of endogenous antioxidant enzymes including catalase, superoxide dismutases, and peroxiredoxins. The transcription of these cytoprotective enzymes is regulated by the nuclear transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which plays a central role in the regulation of cellular redox status. Under normal homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 transcription is repressed by its negative regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). However, following exposure to ROS, Nrf2 dissociates from cytosolic Keap1 and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter regions of the genes that encode antioxidant enzymes and induce their transcription (15). The antioxidant enzyme system regulated by the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway is primarily composed of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), γ-glutamine cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

24736877|t|In the present study, we hypothesized that the administration of EGCG would significantly inhibit irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We first evaluated the efficacy of EGCG to ameliorate irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and then examined whether EGCG treatment influenced Nrf-2, HO-1 and NQO-1 levels in irradiated rats. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess and highlight the efficacy of EGCG in the treatment of irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

24736877|t|Male 6- to 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China) weighing 180–200 g were housed in an SPF-graded animal care facility according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and Academy of Military Medical Sciences for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences approved the protocol. All interventions were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Rats were provided with pathogen-free water and food for maintenance and caged in a controlled SPF environment with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were observed daily up to 4 months post-irradiation, with particular attention afforded to difficulties in breathing, ruffling of the fur, hunched posture, and decreased breathing rate. The natural death of the animals was recorded.

24736877|a|

24736877|t|A 60Co irradiator [Reviss Services (UK), Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK] was used to generate gamma-ray radiation. The rats were irradiated to 22 Gy at a dose rate of 290 cGy/min. The beam was restricted to the entire thorax. After anesthetization with 3% sodium pentobarbital (45 mg/kg) and irradiation as described above, the rats were intraperitoneally injected with EGCG (25 mg/kg; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (n=40) or dexamethasone (DEX; n=40; 5 mg/kg; Tianjing Pharmaceuticals Group Corp., Tianjing, China) daily for 30 days. Irradiated rats (radiation only; n=40) received radiation without treatment. The control group (n=40) was composed of normally fed, age-matched animals that were not irradiated. Similar doses of EGCG (25 mg/kg) were used in previous studies (11–13).

24736877|t|After measuring body weight, six rats from each group were sacrificed at 15, 30, 60 or 120 days after initiation of the experiment. The wet weight of the lungs was recorded for each animal. The left lungs were frozen with dry ice powder and kept at −70°C for later use. The right lungs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Blood samples were collected from the heart and allowed to clot for 1 h at room temperature. Serum samples were obtained by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and then stored at −70°C. The right lungs were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Lung sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson’s trichrome (Masson) and Sirius red.

24736877|t|Serum samples were assayed for MDA content and SOD activity using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute). MDA, an end product of ROS-induced peroxidation of cell membrane lipids, is a reliable marker of oxidative damage (16). MDA content was determined by measuring chromogen generation from the reaction of MDA with 2-thiobarbituric acid. SOD activity was measured by monitoring the sample’s capacity to inhibit the reduction of ferricytochrome c via xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Briefly, this method is dependent on the inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction via the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system as a superoxide generator (17).

24736877|a|

24736877|t|Lung sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated through a graded alcohol series, and exposed to a microwave-based antigen retrieval with a citrate buffer (10 mM of sodium citrate, pH 6.0 for 15 min). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched using 3% H2O2 for 5 min. The sections were incubated with surfactant protein-B (SPB; 1:200) or α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; 1:200) (both from Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan, China) antibodies at 37°C for 2 h. The primary antibody was omitted in the negative control samples. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with poly-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG for 30 min at 37°C using the Polymer-HRP Detection System (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The slides were visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated through increasing concentrations of alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted in neutral balsam (Sigma).

24736877|t|Frozen left lungs were pulverized and lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected for total protein analysis. A BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) was used to determine protein concentrations. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA), and incubated with 5% BSA at room temperature for 2.5 h to block non-specific binding. The membranes were then incubated with the following primary antibodies at room temperature for 3 h: Nrf-2 (1:200; Sigma), HO-1 (1:200), NQO-1 (1:200) (both from Millipore) or β-actin (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence with a Super Signal detection kit (Boster Biological Technology).

24736877|a|

24736877|t|Following the methodology described by Szapiel et al (18), lung sections stained with H&E or Masson’s trichrome were scored for alveolitis and fibrosis, respectively. Briefly, the severity of alveolitis and fibrosis was graded and scored on a scale of 0–3 (18): grade 0, normal lung; grade 1, minimal lesion (lesion area <20%); grade 2, moderate lesion (lesion area, 20–50%); or grade 3, severe lesion (lesion area >50%). Ten fields per section at ×100 magnification were randomly selected per rat, and two blinded pathologists carefully and independently examined 60 fields per group using an Olympus microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The total score of each section was calculated, and the mean score of each group was determined as the total score of all sections divided by six. Lung sections stained with Sirius red were observed and images were captured using a polarizing microscope. For the immunohistochemical analyses of SPB and α-SMA, staining density was determined using Image Proplus software in one field with a prominent DAB reaction for each section under ×200 magnification for a total of six fields per group. Large airways and lung vessels were excluded from all analyses.

24736877|t|Congested edema and bleeding sites were significantly attenuated in DEX-treated pulmonary tissues compared with radiation-only animals at 15 and 30 days post-irradiation. Pulmonary collapse and gray fibrous nodules were similar in DEX-treated and radiation-only animals at 60 and 120 days post-irradiation. Bleeding sites were seldom observed in EGCG-treated pulmonary tissues at 15 days post-irradiation. Signs of congested edema were also significantly attenuated in EGCG-treated pulmonary tissues compared with DEX-treated and radiation-only tissues at 15, 30 and 60 days post-irradiation. At 120 days post-irradiation, the lungs of EGCG-treated rats showed signs of edema and uneven surfaces as well as scattered punctuate bleeding points. However, neither pulmonary collapse nor gray fibrous nodules were found in EGCG-treated animals at 120 days post-irradiation (Fig. 1). These results suggested that EGCG significantly ameliorates irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

This result matches the morphometric observations of lung appearance in EGCG-treated animals at 120 days post-irradiation (Fig. 1). At this time point, edema was still detectable in EGCG-treated animals but was not detected in DEX-treated and untreated irradiated animals. The lung index score was significantly lower (p<0.05) among the DEX-treated animals relative to the radiation-only animals at 15, 30 and 60 days post-irradiation but similar at 120 days post-irradiation (p>0.05; Fig. 2A).

24736877|t|We examined whether EGCG treatment improves the histological changes that occur in pulmonary tissues post-irradiation. We performed H&E, Masson’s trichrome and Sirius red staining of the lung sections to observe histological changes. A semi-quantitative analysis involving alveolitis and fibrosis scores was performed on the H&E- and Masson-stained sections following Szapiel’s method (18). Markedly thickened alveolar walls, collapsed alveoli, foam-like cells in the alveolar space, diffuse accumulations of inflammatory cells, extensive depositions of collagen, and regional fibrotic foci were observed in the H&E-stained irradiated pulmonary tissues at 120 days post-irradiation. Treatment with EGCG, but not DEX, significantly improved irradiation-induced pathological changes (Fig. 3, left column). Similarly, Masson’s trichrome (Fig. 3, middle column) and Sirius red staining (Fig. 3, right column) of the lung sections revealed that the regional fibrotic foci and collagen depositions were greatly reduced after EGCG treatment.

24736877|t|The activation and proliferation of (myo)fibroblasts are important contributors to pulmonary fibrosis. Injury to the AE2 cells directly and indirectly contributes to the effects of irradiation-induced pulmonary injury. Therefore, we investigated the effects of EGCG on (myo)fibroblasts and AE2 cells. The expression of α-SMA, a (myo)fibroblast marker, and SPB, an AE2 marker, was investigated using immunohistochemistry on the lung sections. Strong α-SMA expression was observed in the irradiated pulmonary tissues at 120 days post-irradiation. Treatment with EGCG, but not DEX, significantly reduced α-SMA expression (Fig. 5, left column). Conversely, weak SPB expression was observed in the irradiated pulmonary tissues at 120 days post-irradiation. Treatment with EGCG, but not DEX, significantly enhanced SPB expression (Fig. 5, right column).

24736877|t|A morphometric analysis of α-SMA and SPB immunohistochemistry as described in Materials and methods was performed. The OD value for α-SMA immunohistochemistry was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the EGCG-treated animals compared with the DEX-treated animals at 60 and 120 days post-irradiation. The OD value for α-SMA immunohistochemistry in the DEX-treated animals was similar to that of the radiation-only animals at 15, 30, 60 and 120 days post-irradiation (p>0.05; Fig. 4C).

These results confirmed that EGCG inhibits (myo)fibroblast proliferation and protects AE2 cells from injury post-irradiation.

24736877|t|Discussion
24736877|a|

24736877|t|Results of the present study have shown that irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats is principally ameliorated by EGCG administration. EGCG treatment reduced the mortality rate and lung index score, alleviated lung histological damage, reduced collagen deposition, modulated the redox state of serum, inhibited (myo)fibroblast proliferation, protected AE2 cells, and regulated the serum levels of TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. We also showed that EGCG treatment activated Nrf-2 and its downstream antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1. The DEX treatment of irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis did not produce similarly ameliorative effects. Given these results, we demonstrated that EGCG treatment significantly ameliorates irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our data reveal that EGCG has potential for treatments of irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

24736877|t|Increasing evidence indicates that oxidative stress and ROS contribute directly and indirectly to the formation of irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (19). The ROS-induced activation of inflammatory cells (including macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils) can cause a positive feedback loop in which an increased expression of a variety of intracellular oxidative enzymes and large amounts of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are synthesized and released to remove necrotic tissue (20,21). The dynamics of the oxidant/antioxidant balance in the lung are destroyed, and tissue damage persistently increases. Therefore, any therapeutic intervention that defends against or alleviates oxidant insults may be used to treat irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Due to its potent antioxidant activity, a variety of animal models have shown that the tea polyphenol EGCG is an effective scavenger of ROS and free radicals with regard to tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases both in vitro and in vivo (15). The antioxidant activity of EGCG (which likely involves the quenching of ROS, the interception of free radicals, or both) is most likely mediated by an H-atom transfer (HAT) reaction in which intramolecular hydrogen bonding stabilizes the resultant phenoxy radical (22). Previous studies have suggested that EGCG administration inhibits lipopolysaccharide (8) and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (11–13). Thus, we hypothesized that scavenging free radicals with EGCG, a natural antioxidant extracted from green tea, inhibits irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

24736877|t|MDA levels and total SOD activity in serum are important indicators of oxidative stress and the body’s capacity to respond to induced oxidative stress. MDA levels most likely reflect the degree of organic lipid peroxidation, which denotes the severity of damage to cell membranes (23). Conversely, SOD plays a crucial role in the organic oxidative/antioxidant balance. This enzyme can neutralize free radical forms of oxygen, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. Moreover, injections of SOD (24) and the SOD mimetic AEOL 10113 (25) have shown protective effects in animal models of radiation-induced fibrosis. Our investigation showed that the serum levels of MDA and inflammatory cytokines decreased, and serum SOD activity increased in DEX-treated animals compared with radiation-only animals at 15 and 30 days post-irradiation. However, these therapeutic benefits ceased with treatment. EGCG-treated rats had greater SOD activity than any other group of rats, including the non-irradiated normal controls, at all time points (15–120 days post-irradiation). This result suggests that EGCG reduced oxidative stress, at least in part, by increasing the systemic production of antioxidant proteins. Overall, our results have demonstrated that EGCG is superior to DEX with regard to increasing the body’s capacity to handle oxidative stress due to ROS/RNS, and these effects were sustained long after treatment was discontinued.

24736877|t|The development of irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis is also related to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, which play an important role in creating a positive feedback loop to reinforce the chemotaxis of macrophages and neutrophils and sustaining oxidative stress by supporting the enhanced production of ROS/RNS (26). TGF-β1 is a powerful cytokine that can promote fibroblast proliferation and maturation, thereby accelerating the development of pulmonary fibrosis (27). Wang et al demonstrated that TGF-β1 levels were positively correlated with the incidence of radiation-treatment-induced lung injury among patients with lung cancer (28). TNF-α is a driving factor within pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory networks and is likely involved in the development and progression of radiation-induced pneumonitis (29). In addition, TNF-α stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-6, from neutrophils and macrophages (30). IL-6 plays an important role in the formation and proliferation of fibrous connective tissue, potentially by increasing collagen aggregation, inhibiting extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and stimulating fibroblast proliferation. Previous studies have suggested that IL-6 leads to inflammation and fibrosis associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in mice. These results suggest a close relationship in IL-6 and pneumonitis and fibrotic development (31). IL-10 may inhibit monocytes, macrophages, and Th1 cells as well as enhance B-cell immune regulation function (32). In addition, IL-10 is a T-cell-derived cytokine of the Th-2 family that suppresses inflammation by inhibiting numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines (33). Findings of Barbarin et al have shown that silica-induced pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in mice caused the overexpression of IL-10, thereby contributing to the increased lung damage caused by fibrosis (34).

24736877|t|To investigate the effects of EGCG treatment on systemic inflammation, we measured the serum levels of key inflammatory cytokines including TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. These cytokines were significantly reduced in the EGCG-treated animals compared with the untreated and steroid-treated rats, and this effect lasted for months after treatment ceased. The lower alveolitis score of the EGCG-treated rats also suggested that EGCG reduces the infiltration of inflammatory immune cells. Results of this study are in agreement with those of previous studies that have shown significant anti-inflammatory effects from the administration of EGCG (10,35,36).

24736877|t|This study also investigated the protective effect of EGCG on AE2 cells. AE2 and vascular endothelial cells are the two major targets of radiation-induced lung injury from inflammation and oxidative stress. Results of the SPB staining analysis in the lung revealed that EGCG-treated rats showed a more normalized distribution of AE2 cells in the parenchyma compared with radiation-only and DEX-treated rats. AE2 cells were abundant in alveolar walls of the lung tissues of the EGCG-treated rats, although no evidence of dysplasia was found. These results suggest that EGCG protected parenchymal and AE2 cells from free radical damage. In addition, the myofibroblast proliferation in the lung (as demonstrated by α-SMA staining) observed in the radiation-only and DEX-treated groups was significantly reduced in rats treated with EGCG at 60 and 120 days after irradiation, suggesting that EGCG-inhibited pulmonary fibrosis partially inhibits myofibroblast transformation and proliferation.

24736877|t|We also examined whether EGCG improves the ability of the endogenous oxidative stress response system by activating Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant enzymes. Sriram et al investigated the protective effects of EGCG in a bleomycin-induced acute lung injury animal model and presented the first evidence that EGCG protection against lung injury is associated with the Nrf2-based activation of the oxidative stress response (12). Nrf2 plays a critical role in the regulation of the major antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1. Sahin et al (37) reported that EGCG significantly reduced the production of peroxides and the subsequent peroxidation of lipids by enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD, CAT, and GPx) to improve the oxidative stress response. Those authors also showed that EGCG may increase the downstream expression of other antioxidant enzymes by activating Nrf2 and HO-1, thereby regulating oxidative stress. Our western blot analysis results revealed that EGCG significantly enhanced the expression levels of Nrf-2, HO-1, and NQO-1 in rat lung tissues compared with radiation-only and DEX-treated rats, thereby confirming the results of Sriram et al and Sahin et al (12,37) as well as supporting our hypothesis that EGCG relieves oxidative stress by activating Nrf2 and its associated antioxidant enzymes.

24736877|t|Since glucocorticosteroids are commonly used to treat irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and other forms of lung fibrosis in humans, DEX was selected as a baseline to compare the efficacy of EGCG using various measures of lung inflammation, the oxidative stress response, and fibrosis. A marginal effectiveness was achieved with DEX therapy at 15 and 30 days post-irradiation; however, these improvements ceased following discontinuing steroid therapy (i.e., at 60 and 120 days post-irradiation). The measures of lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis among the DEX-treated rats were similar to those of the radiation-only group at 60 and 120 days post-irradiation, suggesting a lack of persistent therapeutic effects. Conversely, our results demonstrate that EGCG was superior to glucocorticoids with regard to reducing inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress during the treatment period (which ended at 30 days post-irradiation). In addition, the therapeutic effects of EGCG were sustained even after treatment ceased, unlike the steroid treatment.

24736877|t|Collectively, results of the present study have shown that EGCG treatment provides strong, persistent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative effects that protect against irradiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The findings suggest that these effects are mediated by inhibiting pro-inflammatory immune cells from infiltrating alveoli and lung parenchyma, suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of ROS/RNS-free radicals that cause extensive oxidative damage to parenchymal cells. EGCG also inhibited myofibroblast proliferation and AE2 cell dysplasia, presumably by suppressing the secretion of TGF-β1. Of note, the findings demonstrate that these effects reduced the rates of morbidity and mortality compared with those among the rats in the DEX group.

24969229|t|Background
24969229|a|

24969229|t|Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a C18 fatty acid with conjugated double bonds, has been shown to serve as a powerful anti-obesity agent by several research groups, although the precise mechanism remains elusive. Previous studies showed that CLA induced apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells and in mice. The aim of this research was to clarify the role of CLA in adipocyte apoptosis in pigs, a relevant model for obesity research.

24969229|t|Results
24969229|a|

24969229|t|Our results clearly show that back fat deposition of CLA-fed pigs was significantly lower than that of pigs in the control group. Moreover, some typical apoptotic cells were observed among the adipocytes of CLA-fed pigs. Furthermore, the CLA-fed pigs had reduced expression of the anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 and increased expression of the pro-apoptosis factors Bax and P53. Subsequently, increased cytochrome C was released from the mitochondria to the endochylema, and the caspase cascade was activated, resulting in cellular apoptosis. These results are consistent with the effects of Bcl-2 and Bax in regulating CLA-induced adipocyte apoptosis via the mitochondrial signaling pathway. However, the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and its receptor TNFR indicate that the effect of CLA might partly be through the death receptor signaling pathway in adipose cells.

24969229|t|Conclusions
24969229|a|

24969229|t|Our study has demonstrated that CLA reduces pig body fat deposition, an outcome that is partly meditated by apoptosis of adipose cells, and that both the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway are involved in this effect.

24969229|t|Background
24969229|a|

24969229|t|Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) belongs to the family of 18 carbon fatty acids containing conjugated double bonds. It is found in dairy products and ruminant meats as a mixture of positional and geometric (Cis or Trans) isomers of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6). There is increasing evidence that CLA has powerful anti-adiposity functions in both humans and animals [1-3]. CLA treatment notably decreases body fat deposition and changes the route of fat metabolism, effects that have been observed in several different studies [2-6]. Although the precise mechanism is still unclear, results of these studies demonstrate that CLA may inhibit the proliferation and/or differentiation of adipose cells, and the synthesis and accumulation of triglycerides in adipocytes.

24969229|t|Recently, some research groups have shown that CLA can induce apoptosis of fat cells in mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In 2000, Tsuboyama-Kasaoka et al. first reported that supplying feed supplemented with 1% CLA to C57BL/6 J mice for 5 months resulted in a clear decrease in the abdominal fat pad of the mice, with the adipocytes exhibiting typical apoptotic characteristics, such as DNA fragmentation [7]. Subsequent studies showed that CLA also induced adipose cell apoptosis either in vitro or in vivo[8-11]. It has long been known that CLA has anti-cancer effects and can directly induce apoptosis of a number of different tumor cell types [12-15]. However, the effects of CLA on apoptosis in adipose cells have not been widely reported, and the molecular mechanisms by which these effects occur are still unclear.

24969229|t|In our experiment, piglets were fed with 0, 1%, or 2% CLA for 30 days. Both the 1% and 2% CLA-fed pigs demonstrated a loss of body weight compared with the control pigs by the end of the experiment. Back fat tissue and abdominal fat pads of the piglets were collected, weighed, and analyzed. The results showed that CLA-fed pigs had less body fat deposition, particularly of back fat (P < 0.05, Table 1). Additionally, CLA-fed pigs demonstrated an increased accumulation of intramuscular fat, indicating that CLA has tissue-based differential effects on fat metabolism.

24969229|t|A number of molecules and signal transduction pathways participate in the apoptotic process. Back fat tissue of CLA-fed pigs had lower expression of Bcl-2, a key inhibitor of cellular apoptosis, at both mRNA (Figure 4A) and protein (Figure 4B) levels. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax were slightly increased in the back fat of CLA-fed pigs (Figure 4A and B). These two factors function in the early part of the mitochondrial signaling pathway, and changes in their expression initiate activation, and significantly increase the expression, of P53, as well as the release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm (Figure 4A and B). Activity of caspase-9 showed a corresponding increase to 1.4 fold (Figure 4C), and expression level and activity of caspase-3 (Figure 4A and D), a key apoptotic protein, both increased significantly. These results suggest that the mitochondrial signaling pathway plays a key role in CLA-induced apoptosis of pig adipocytes.

24969229|t|We also examined the mRNA level and the circulating concentration of TNF-α, an inflammatory factor and apoptosis inducer secreted by adipocytes. A previous study reported that TNF-α could induce cellular apoptosis as a ligand that activates the death receptor signaling pathway [16]. Compared with control pigs, 2% CLA–fed pigs showed significantly increased TNF-α mRNA expression (Figure 5A) in their back fat tissue (P < 0.05). However, the circulating concentration of TNF-α protein (Figure 5B) was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Therefore, we speculate that a high level of TNF-α in back fat might play a role in the induction of adipocyte apoptosis by CLA. Furthermore, higher expression levels of TNFR (Figure 5C and D) and higher activity of caspase-8 (Figure 5E) in the fat tissue of CLA-fed pigs indirectly support this suggestion.

24969229|t|Discussion
24969229|a|

24969229|t|Fat metabolism and its related syndromes have been a primary focus of scientific research for many years. An increasing number of agents have been discovered for treating obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes [17,18]. In recent years, CLA, because of its robust anti-obesity effects, has gained increasing attention in studies on fat metabolism. Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that young pigs administered CLA-supplemented feeds have less body fat (particularly back fat).

24969229|t|The apoptotic process is characterized by programmed cell death regulated by numerous genes [19]. Owing to the characteristics of adipocytes (a large amount of intracellular lipid droplets and a consequent difficulty to form apoptotic bodies), apoptosis research in adipocytes has been less than that in other cell types. However, some recent studies have led to the belief that there is no obvious difference between apoptosis in adipocytes and apoptosis in other cells [20,21]. CLA has long been considered an effective anti-cancer drug because it can induce apoptosis in various tumor cells and/or enhance the cells’ susceptibility to apoptosis. Very few papers have reported that CLA can also induce adipocyte apoptosis in rodents, or in adipocyte cell lines [7-10]. To investigate whether CLA also induces apoptosis in pig adipocytes, the key aim of the current study, we examined (and detected typical apoptotic phenomena in adipose cells from the CLA-fed pigs (particularly in the 2% CLA-fed pigs), as we had expected. We therefore have reason to believe that CLA can exert its anti-obesity function, at least partly, via inducing apoptosis in adipose cells.

24969229|t|The mechanisms of apoptosis are highly complex and sophisticated, involving an energy-dependent cascade of molecular events [19]. To date, research indicates that there are two main apoptotic pathways, the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway [19,22]. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge on the same execution pathway. This pathway is initiated by the cleavage of caspase-3 and results in DNA fragmentation, degradation of cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins, cross-linking of proteins, formation of apoptotic bodies, and finally uptake by phagocytic cells [23]. Changes in both expression and activity of key apoptosis factors in the current experiment suggest that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated in the fat tissue of CLA-fed pigs (Figure 6). In fact, there is recent evidence showing that the two pathways are linked, and that molecules in one pathway can influence the other [24].

24969229|t|In the intrinsic pathway, stimuli such as drugs, radiation, or hypoxia induce DNA injury, change mitochondrial permeability, and then discharge more active apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome C, which then combine with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9 to form an apoptosome. In this complex, self-cleavage and activation of procaspase-9 generates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 in the presence of ATP. In this process, the Bcl-2 protein family plays a critical role. The family includes many proteins that are categorized based on their function as either pro-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w) or anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid) [25,26]. Bcl-2 inhibits the release of cytochrome C and inhibits the function of activated caspases while Bax has the opposite effect. P53 is a transcription factor that is often seen as an important pro-apoptotic factor because DNA-injury-increased P53 induces the expression of Bax and promotes the release of cytochrome C [27,28]. Based on the changes in the expression and activity of Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C, P53, and caspase-9, our results suggest that the intrinsic pathway plays an important role in the CLA-induced apoptosis of adipocytes. Similar studies have also shown the importance of the intrinsic pathway in this process.

24969229|t|In the extrinsic pathway, death factors (such as TNF-α) function as ligands that bind to their respective receptor proteins (for example, TNFR is a receptor for TNF-α), which then induces Fas-associated with death domain protein to combine with procaspase-8 to form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Self-cleavage and activation of procaspase-8 in the DISC generates caspase-8 and subsequently activates caspase-3 [29]. TNF-α is a powerful pro-apoptotic factor secreted by fat in mammals [30]. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka et al. observed a six-fold increase of Tnfa mRNA level in 1% CLA-fed mice, and suggested that the increase was related to adipocyte apoptosis and decreased fat deposition [7]. In our studies, the increased expression of TNF-α, TNFR and the increased activity of caspase-8 demonstrate that the extrinsic pathway also participates in adipocyte apoptosis induced by CLA.

24969229|t|Conclusion
24969229|a|

24969229|t|As a potent anti-obesity agent, CLA has gained a lot of attention and its mechanism of action is gradually becoming clear. Though some studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of differentiation of adipocytes is the main mechanism by which CLA induces anti-obesity effects, we believe that CLA decreases body fat deposition in pigs at least partly by inducing adipocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, both the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway participate in this event.

Forty-eight healthy pigs (Duroc × landrace × yorkshire, male) of approximately 14 kg body weight were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 16 in each group): a control group (0 CLA), a 1% CLA group, and a 2% CLA group, and their feed was supplemented with the corresponding level of a CLA mixture (c9, t11-CLA: t10, c12-CLA = 1:1, purchased from Aohai Biotechnology Co, Ltd. Qingdao, China). The experiment was conducted for 30 days, and food and water were offered to the animals ad libitum during this period. The diet formulation met the Chinese meat-fat type pig feeding standard (NY/T 95-2004).

24969229|t|Activity levels of caspase-3, -8, and -9 in the fat tissue were measured using commercial assay kits (Beyotime, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein was extracted from the fat tissue after grinding and subsequent lysing of the tissue in lysis buffer on ice. The protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Reagent (TianGen, Beijing, China). For the caspase-3 activity assay, equal amounts of total lysates were mixed with caspase-3 assay buffer containing the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD- pNA (2 mM) in a 96-well plate in triplicate. Caspase-3 mediated cleavage of Ac-DEVD-pNA into free pNA (yellow) was measured using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm, in a microplate reader (Gene Company Limited, Hong Kong, China). The fluorogenic substrates in the caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity assays were Ac-IETD-pNA (for caspase-8) and Ac-LEHD-pNA (for caspase-9), and the absorption wavelength used for both was 405 nm.

25411045|t|Background
25411045|a|

25411045|t|Paclitaxel, which is widely used for the treatment of solid tumors, causes neuropathic pain via poorly understood mechanisms. Previously, we have demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its receptors (LPA1 and LPA3) are required for the initiation of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. The present study aimed to clarify whether LPA and its receptors could mediate paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain.

25411045|a|

25411045|t|Intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel triggered a marked increase in production of LPA species (18:1-, 16:0-, and 18:0-LPA) in the spinal dorsal horn. Also, we found significant activations of spinal cytosolic phospholipase A2 and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 after the paclitaxel treatment. The paclitaxel-induced LPA production was completely abolished not only by intrathecal pretreatment with neurokinin 1 (NK1) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, but also in LPA1 receptor-deficient (Lpar1−/−) and LPA3 receptor-deficient (Lpar3−/−) mice. In addition, the pharmacological blockade of NK1 or NMDA receptor prevented a reduction in the paw withdrawal threshold against mechanical stimulation after paclitaxel treatments. Importantly, the paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia was absent in Lpar1−/− and Lpar3−/− mice.

25411045|t|Background
25411045|a|

25411045|t|Peripheral neuropathic pain is produced by multiple etiologies, including physical trauma, metabolic diseases, viral infections, and chemotherapeutic agents [1, 2]. Paclitaxel (Taxol®) is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for various types of solid tumors such as breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. The treatment with paclitaxel is often accompanied by neuropathic pain, which is a major dose-limiting adverse effect and impairs the quality of life in patients [3, 4]. The abnormal pain can be developed as early as day 1 in patients [5] and several hours in animals [6] after initial treatment, and last for months to years after repeated administrations [4]. Until now, there is a lack of effective treatment for paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain owing to the poor understanding of its molecular mechanisms.

25411045|t|Previously, we have clarified that lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPA1) signaling initiates peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain and its underlying mechanisms, including demyelination [7]. Also, a single intrathecal injection of LPA evokes abnormal pain that mimics nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, in terms of its pain phenotype, pharmacological characterization, and biochemical alterations [7–10]. Regarding the biosynthesis of LPA in the spinal cord, simultaneous intense stimulation with neurokinin 1 (NK1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates phospholipase A2 to produce lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which is then converted to LPA by extracellular autotaxin enzyme [11]. Interestingly, intrathecally administrated LPA is capable of causing amplification of spinal LPA production [12, 13]. Furthermore, nerve injury causes amplification of spinal LPA production via LPA1 and LPA3 receptors [13], and, accordingly, nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain is absent in mice that are deficient in LPA1 or LPA3 receptors [7, 13]. These facts have suggested that LPA1 and LPA3 receptors-mediated amplification of spinal LPA production is required for the induction of neuropathic pain after nerve injury. However, whether LPA and its receptors could contribute to different types of peripheral neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, remains to be determined. The present study showed that paclitaxel triggered LPA1 and LPA3 receptors-mediated amplification of spinal LPA production, by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) with phosphate-capture molecule, Phos-tag. Furthermore, we found that paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia was robustly abolished in mice deficient in LPA1 or LPA3 receptors.

25411045|a|

25411045|t|According to the manufacturer’s protocol and our previous studies [13, 17], the activities of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) in the dorsal half of spinal cord were assessed by using cPLA2 assay kit (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). To assess cPLA2 activity, bromoenol lactone, a specific iPLA2 inhibitor [18], was added to the assay buffer. To measure the activity of iPLA2, sample was incubated with the substrate arachidonoyl thio-phosphorylcholine in modified Ca2+-free buffer (4 mM EGTA, 160 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 8 mM Triton X-100, 60% glycerol, 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin). The activity of PLA2 was defined as the percentage of the control activity as follows: paclitaxel-treated tissues (absorbance/mg of protein)/normal tissues (absorbance/mg of protein) × 100.

25411045|t|LPA was extracted from the unilateral dorsal half of the lumber (L4-L6) spinal cord (6.15 mg tissue weight), as reported previously [13, 19, 20]. The final sample was dissolved in 50 μl of methanol containing 0.1% aqueous ammonia for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. One μl sample was spotted on a MALDI plate (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., CA, USA). Immediately, 1 μl of 2’,4’,6’-trihydroxyacetophenone monohydrate solution (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile) was layered on the mixture as matrix solution. After drying, the sample was applied to Ultraflex-I™ TOF/TOF systems (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., CA, USA). Mass spectrometry was performed in the positive mode, using an accelerating voltage of 25 kV. The laser was used at energy of 30-50% (3.0-5.0 μJ) and a repetition rate of 10-Hz. The mass spectra were calibrated externally using Peptide calibration standard (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., CA, USA). Each spectrum was produced by accumulating data from 150 or 300 consecutive laser shots. Standard of 18:1-LPA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), while standards of 16:0-, 17:0- and 18:0-LPA were obtained from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (London, ON, Canada).

25411045|t|The mechanical paw pressure test was carried out, as described previously [7]. Briefly, mice were placed in a plexiglass chamber on a 6 × 6 mm wire mesh grid floor and allowed to acclimatize for a period of 1 h. A mechanical stimulus was then delivered onto the middle of the plantar surface of the animal using a Transducer Indicator (Model 1601; IITC Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA). The pressure needed to evoke a flexor response was defined as the pain threshold. A cut-off pressure of 20 g was set to avoid tissue damage.

25411045|t|Firstly, we assessed whether paclitaxel could induce LPA production in the spinal dorsal horn. In order to measure the levels of LPA species (18:1-, 16:0-, and 18:0-LPA), we performed quantitative MALDI-TOF-MS method with phosphate-capture molecule, Phos-tag, as reported previously [13, 19–21]. According to the ratios of ion-peak intensities with each standard of LPA species to that with internal standard 17:0 LPA (0.2 nmol), we have already validated the linearity of each calibration curve over the concentration range of 0.1-2.0 nmol [13]. Based on the calibration curves, the concentrations of LPA species were determined by measuring the ion-signals at m/z 997, 1023, and 1025, corresponding to 16:0-, 18:1-, and 18:0-LPA, respectively. As shown in Figure 1, the level of 18:1-LPA, which preferentially activates LPA1 and LPA3 receptors to initiate nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain [13], was gradually increased in the spinal dorsal horn after intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (4 mg/kg) and peaked at 24 h post-injection, followed by decline at 72 h post-injection. Similar alterations were also seen in the 16:0- and 18:0-LPA levels (Figure 1).

25411045|t|Discussion
25411045|a|

25411045|t|There is emerging evidence that LPA mediates not only peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain [7], but also other chronic pain, such as ischemia-induced central neuropathic pain [24] and bone cancer pain [25]. Here, we focused on the paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain that can be observed in both clinic and animal studies [3]. The most important finding of the present study is that paclitaxel-induced spinal LPA production and the development of neuropathic pain were absent in Lpar1−/− and Lpar3−/− mice. This suggests, for the first time, the critical involvement of LPA and its receptors LPA1 and LPA3 in paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, a predictable adverse effect.

25411045|t|Our previous report has shown that peripheral nerve injury activates spinal iPLA2 and cPLA2 at 1 h post-injury, followed by spinal LPA production at 3 h post-injury [17]. Regarding mechanisms for the LPA biosynthesis, simultaneous stimuli of excitatory neurotransmitters, SP and glutamate, are capable of evoking LPA production in the spinal cord slices [11]. Indeed, pharmacological blockade of NK1 or NMDA receptor completely inhibits injury-induced iPLA2 and cPLA2 activation and LPA production [13]. In the present study, we found that paclitaxel caused a significant increase in spinal iPLA2 and cPLA2 activities at 12 h post-injection, followed by spinal LPA production at 24 h post-injection. In addition, the pretreatment with intrathecal NK1 or NMDA receptor antagonist completely blocked the paclitaxel-induced LPA production. These findings prompted us to hypothesize that paclitaxel could activate spinal iPLA2 and cPLA2, possibly via the increase in SP and glutamate levels, thereby leading to LPA production. In this context, paclitaxel, which poorly penetrates blood–brain-barrier, is known to accumulate in the dorsal root ganglion [26–28], indicating that paclitaxel could alter the functions of primary afferents to cause peripheral and central sensitization. For instance, there are reports showing that paclitaxel induces SP release from cultured primary afferent neurons [29, 30]. Moreover, paclitaxel has been found to cause a down-regulation of glial transporters, such as glutamate-aspartate transporter and glutamate transporter-1 in the spinal astrocyte as early as 4 h after paclitaxel injection [31], indicating that synaptic glutamate level would be increased in the spinal dorsal horn after paclitaxel administration. These mechanisms might explain the reasons why the paclitaxel-induced spinal iPLA2 and cPLA2 activation and subsequent LPA production are delayed as compared with the case of peripheral nerve injury.

25411045|t|Previously, we have demonstrated that a single intrathecal injection of LPA increases spinal LPA level [12, 13]. Also, nerve injury-induced production of LPA species is absent in Lpar1−/− and Lpar3−/− mice [13], indicating the involvement of LPA1 and LPA3 receptors in self-amplification of LPA production. Interestingly, 18:1-LPA, which preferentially activates LPA1 and LPA3 receptors, induces not only amplification of LPA production but also neuropathic thermal hyperalgesia [13]. In contrast, neither 16:0- nor 18:0-LPA triggers LPA production and neuropathic pain-like behavior [13]. Here, we showed that paclitaxel evoked a significant production of LPA species (18:1-, 16:0-, and 18:0-LPA), and such LPA production was absent in Lpar1−/− and Lpar3−/− mice. Therefore, it is logical to postulate that activations of LPA1 and LPA3 receptors, possibly by 18:1-LPA, are required for paclitaxel-induced amplification of LPA production. LPA can activate primary afferents, thereby evoking the release of SP from nerve endings via LPA1 receptor [32, 33]. Therefore, there is a possibility that LPA1 receptor might be involved in amplification of LPA production via the release of SP from presynaptic terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Alternatively, LPA1 and LPA3 receptors are expressed in microglia [34, 35], indicating microglial LPA1 and LPA3 receptors might induce the release of biological factors that activate iPLA2 and cPLA2 to cause LPA production. One such candidate is interleukin-1β, which mediates LPA-induced LPA production via activations of iPLA2 and cPLA2 [36].

25411045|t|Tatsushima et al. reported that a single intrathecal injection of NK1 receptor antagonist alleviates the established mechanical allodynia after repeated treatments with paclitaxel [30], suggesting an involvement of SP in the maintenance of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. Although NMDA receptor antagonist reverses the established mechanical allodynia after paclitaxel injections [37], inconsistent observation has been reported [38]. Therefore, the authors have mentioned that NMDA receptor activation is unlikely to have a major role in the maintenance of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain [37, 38]. On the other hand, the present study clearly showed that the intrathecal pretreatment with NK1 and NMDA receptor antagonists blocked paclitaxel-induced spinal LPA production and mechanical allodynia, suggesting that SP and glutamate are key mediators of the development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain via causing LPA production. Furthermore, the paclitaxel-induced spinal LPA production and mechanical allodynia were absent in Lpar1−/− and Lpar3−/− mice. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that spinally synthesized LPA, whose production is amplified via LPA1 and LPA3 receptors, participates in the pathogenesis of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain.

25411045|t|Regarding the molecular basis for induction of neuropathic pain, we have demonstrated that LPA evokes demyelination of sensory fibers in the dorsal root [7]. In addition, LPA also causes altered expression of pain-related molecules in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn [7]. Furthermore, gene profiling analysis has clarified that LPA initially up-regulates gene expression of ephrinB1, which contributes to LPA-induced neuropathic pain via activation of spinal NMDA receptor [39]. On the other hand, it has been proposed that multiple mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, altered gene expression, and glial activation, are implicated in the mechanisms for paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain [27, 40]. Intriguingly, it seems that some of the mechanisms, such as demyelination and up-regulations of calcium channel α2δ-1 subunit, would be commonly observed in the neuropathic pain caused by paclitaxel and LPA [7, 41, 42]. Alternatively, a recent paper by Wright et al. has shown that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase type 1C has an important role in LPA-induced neuropathic pain [43], raising possibility that such lipid kinase might be involved in the LPA actions underlying paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. Further studies are required for the elucidation of mechanisms via LPA1 and LPA3 receptors underlying paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain.

25758562|t|Introduction
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE type I) or dysfunction (C1-INH-HAE type II) is a rare disease characterized by recurrent episodes of edema with an estimated frequency of 1:50,000 in the global population without racial or gender differences. In this study we present the results of a nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE patients referring to 17 Italian centers, the Italian network for C1-INH-HAE, ITACA.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Methods
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Italian patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study. Diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE was based on family and/or personal history of recurrent angioedema without urticaria and on antigenic and/or functional C1-INH deficiency.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Results
25758562|a|

25758562|t|983 patients (53% female) from 376 unrelated families were included in this survey. Since 1973, 63 (6%) patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE died and data from 3 patients were missing when analysis was performed. Accordingly, the minimum prevalence of HAE in Italy in 2013 is 920:59,394,000 inhabitants, equivalent to 1:64,935. Compared to the general population, patients are less represented in the early and late decades of life: men start reducing after the 5th decade and women after the 6th. Median age of patients is 45 (IQ 28-57), median age at diagnosis is 26 years (IQ 13-41). C1-INH-HAE type 1 are 87%, with median age at diagnosis of 25 (13-40); type 2 are 13% with median age at diagnosis of 31 (IQ 16-49). Functional C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of patients. Antigen C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of type 1. C4 is ≤50% in 96% of patients. The chance of having C1-INH-HAE with C4 plasma levels >50% is < 0.05.

25758562|t|Conclusion
25758562|a|

25758562|t|This nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE provides for Italy a prevalence of 1:64,935. C1-INH-HAE patients listed in our database have a shorter life expectancy than the general population. An increased awareness of the disease is needed to reduce this discrepancy. Measurement of C4 antigen can exclude diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE with an accuracy > 95%. This parameter should be therefore considered for initial screening in differential diagnosis of angioedema.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Background
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 Inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disease due to reduced C1-INH plasma levels (C1-INH-HAE type I) or to the presence of a dysfunctional C1-INH (C1-INH-HAE type II) [1]. C1-INH-HAE type I is estimated to occur in approximately 85% of patients, type II occurs in the remaining 15%. C4 is reduced in both C1-INH-HAE type I and II while C3 is normal [2]. The disease is caused by mutation in C1-INH gene (SERPING1). De novo mutants, i.e. the subjects whose parents have a normal C1-INH, can be identified in approximately 25% of the families [3]. The deficiency of C1-INH results in uncontrolled activation of the contact system and release of bradykinin, the mediator of increased vascular permeability and angioedema manifestations [4,5]. C1-INH-HAE manifests with recurrent episodes of edema of the skin, gastrointestinal tract and upper airway. The disease is disabling and laryngeal edema can lead to asphyxiation and death if left untreated [2].
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Data on the prevalence of C1-INH-HAE are sparse. The estimated frequency worldwide reported in literature varies from 1 every 10,000 to 1 every 150,000 persons without racial or gender differences [6-8]. A nationwide survey in Denmark, based on 76 HAE patients, reported a minimum prevalence of 1:70,922 inhabitants [9]. Previous Norwegian and Spanish studies based on 67 and 444 patients respectively found a minimal prevalence of 1:66,225 and 1:91,743 inhabitants [10,11]. Two more recent surveys in Sweden and in Slovenia based respectively on 145 and 17 patients reported a prevalence of 1:66.000 and 1:105,263 [12,13].
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Since C1-INH-HAE is a genetic disease, the deficiency of C1-INH is present from birth. Nevertheless a minority of patients have perinatal angioedema symptoms. Patients typically begin to present clinical manifestations in childhood and attacks frequency often increase around puberty. Before the second decade of life the majority of patients manifest symptoms of angioedema [14]. Due to the rarity of the disease and to the fact that the clinical symptoms overlap with those of other forms of angioedema, C1-INH-HAE is frequently misdiagnosed. Consequently C1-INH-HAE patients may experience considerable delay between first symptoms and diagnosis. In a recent international observational study analyzing data of patients eligible for Icatibant treatment (Icatibant Outcome Survey, IOS) conducted in 8 European countries the mean delay in diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE patients was 12.8 years [15]. Previous nationwide surveys in France, Spain, and Denmark have reported mean delays in diagnosis of 12, 13.1 and 16.3 years, respectively [9,10,16].

25758562|t|In 1973 Agostoni et al. reported the first Italian family with C1-INH-HAE [17]. After that few centers in Italy have been active in diagnosing and treating this disease [14,18]. In 2007 a multidisciplinary panel of Italian experts in C1-INH-HAE met for a Consensus Conference held in Torino to define Italian guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of C1-INH-HAE [19]. More recently, in 2012 an Italian network for C1-INH-HAE (ITACA) was established. ITACA, working together with the Italian Hereditary Angioedema Patients’ Association, collected data from C1-INH-HAE patients referring to 17 centers active in Italy. Here we provide the results of the analysis of these aggregate data.

25758562|t|Overall 983 patients (53% female) with C1-INH-HAE from 376 unrelated families were included in this analysis. Since 1973, 63 (6%) patients died; furthermore data from 3 patients were missing when analysis were performed. Accordingly, the minimal prevalence of C1-INH-HAE in Italy in 2013 is 1.54:100,000 inhabitants, equivalent to a prevalence of 1:64,935. Median age of patients is 45 (IQ 28-57), median age at diagnosis is 26 years (IQ 13-41). The majority of patients, 859 (87%), have C1-INH-HAE type I with median age at diagnosis of 25 (13-40); patients with type II are 124 (13%) with median age at diagnosis of 31 (IQ 16-49). Demographic characteristics and laboratory assessments are summarized in Table 1. Comparing the distribution per decades of life of patients and of the Italian population we found that patients are less represented in the first decade and after the 7th decade compared to Italian population (p < 0.05) (Figure 1).

25758562|t|Of the 367 unrelated families, 338 (92%) have type I and 53 type II. “Families” with only one subject diagnosed as C1-INH-HAE are 157 (43%). The median age of probands at diagnosis is 34 years. Analyzing 5 year periods, starting from the first diagnosis in the seventies, the number of new probands increased until 1995 and remained stable afterwards (Figure 2). Functional C1-INH is ≤50% in 99% of patients. Antigen C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of type 1 patients. C4 antigen is ≤50% of normal in 96% of patients.

25758562|t|Discussion
25758562|a|

25758562|t|This first nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE in Italy provides a minimum prevalence of 1: 64,935, the highest value ever registered for this disease compared to previous studies. Assuming that our centres collected data on the majority of Italian C1-INH-HAE population, patients not referring to these centres or not diagnosed certainly exist. It is therefore very likely that the real prevalence of C1-INH-HAE is higher approaching the prevalence of 1:50,000 usually reported in literature [20].
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Comparing C1-INH-HAE subjects and general Italian population for distribution in different decades of life, patients are less represented in the early and late decades. In the literature there is no evidence regarding life expectancy in C1-INH-HAE patients. The reduced number in the first and second decade for men can be explained with the delay in diagnosis, which is often made after the second decade of life [1]. The reduced number of patients in first decade can also be explained by the absence of symptoms and by not having systematically studied all the members of the family of every newly diagnosed C1-INH-HAE patient in the past. Interestingly, from 7th decades there are fewer individuals in patients’ group compared to general population. In 1992 Cicardi and Agostoni, analyzing the family histories of an Italian cohort of patients with C1-INH-HAE, reported that up to 50% of patients could have died for asphyxia [12]. This could explain the reason why in Italy C1-INH-HAE patients have had fewer chances, compared to the general population, to reach the late decades. We expect that diagnostic tools and therapeutic options available today will eliminate asphyxia as a common cause of death for C1-INH-HAE patients. This should lead to have patients and general population equally represented in late decades, unless other factors may affect life expectancy. The fact that C1-INH-HAE patients are less represented than general population in the late decades could been related to underdiagnosis in the past. The awareness of C1-INH-HAE has increased in recent years and it is possible that younger patients had more opportunities to be diagnosed than elder patients.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Median age at diagnosis in our patients is 26 year old, which is slightly later than in patients enrolled in IOS study (24.3 year old) [14]. Our study does not report data on delay in diagnosis (defined as time between onset of symptom and diagnosis), but assuming that the large majority of patients becomes symptomatic around puberty we could estimate a minimum delay in diagnosis of 10 years. This result is similar to the delay in diagnosis reported in previous studies. In the cohort of patients analyzed in IOS study the mean delay in diagnosis was 12.8 years [15]. In previous nationwide surveys in France, Spain and Denmark mean delay in diagnosis was 12, 13.1 and 16.3 years, respectively [9,10,16]. Furthermore, we found a considerable difference in the median age at diagnosis between patients with C1-INH-HAE type I and II, 26 and 31 years respectively. This difference was even higher in IOS study, 27.3 and 39.4 respectively. Since diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE type II is made measuring C1-INH function, the limited availability of this test may explain why diagnosing C1-INH-HAE type II is more difficult.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|The number of new diagnosis, calculated as number of probands to avoid the effect caused by large family groups, increased up to 1996, likely due to an improving awareness for this disease. Since that time the annual rate of new diagnosis has remained stable without a trend in reduction suggesting that we are approaching the point at which most Italian C-INH-HAE patients have been diagnosed.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|“Families” with only one subject diagnosed as C1-INH-HAE are 157 (43%). The number of de novo mutants reported in literature is approximately 25% of the families [3]. The high percentage of families with only one subject affected likely includes de novo mutants and patients with non-diagnosed family members. It is mandatory after diagnosis a new patients to evaluate other family members.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|According to diagnostic criteria all patients had either C1-INH antigen or function ≤50%. In absence of published criteria to distinguish type I and II, we considered as type II patients with C1-INH antigen >50% of normal. According to these criteria, 2 patients with C1-INH antigen levels slightly above 50% should have been diagnosed as type II, but they were classified as type I because of, belonging to families whose other members were type I. Similarly, we should have considered as type I 12 patients with C1-INH antigen levels equal or slightly below 50% of normal despite other family members were type II. Finally, 6 patients, with personal and family history of angioedema and C1-INH antigen clearly below 50% of normal, had C1-INH functional levels slightly above 50%. These rare and small discrepancies between suggested diagnostic criteria and actual data highlight the need for comprehensive and thoughtful evaluation of clinical and laboratory findings before placing definitive diagnosis.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|The actual value of antigenic C4 in diagnosing C1-INH-HAE has remained vague. Rosen et al in 1971 first proved the importance of C4 consumption for detecting C1-INH deficiency [21]. Our study demonstrates that C4 plasma levels >50% were rare in C1-INH-HAE patients and can exclude diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE with an error probability lower than 0.05.
25758562|a|

25758562|t|Conclusion
25758562|a|

25758562|t|This nationwide survey on a large number of patients provided evidence that the estimated prevalence of 1:50,000 for C1-INH-HAE is probably close to the real prevalence in general population. Patients with HAE-C1-INH might have a shorter life expectancy compared to general population. An increased awareness of the disease, pedigree’s study, appropriate diagnosis and treatment is needed to reduce the discrepancy in the distribution of decade of life between general population and HAE-C1-INH patients. Measurement of C4 antigen, a cheap assay commonly available in laboratories, can exclude diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE with an accuracy > 95%. This parameter along with clinical data should be therefore considered for initial screening in differential diagnosis of angioedema.

25970440|t|Salt dust in rump lake areas in arid regions has long been considered an extreme stressor for both native plants and crops. In recent years, research on the harmful effects of salt dust on native plants has been published by many scholars, but the effect on crops has been little studied. In this work, in order to determine the impact of salt dust storms on cotton, we simulated salt dust exposure of cotton leaves in Ebinur Basin in Northwest China, and measured the particle sizes and salt ions in the dust, and the photosynthesis, the structure and the cell physiological properties of the cotton leaves. (1) Analysis found that the salt ions and particle sizes in the salt dust used in the experiments were consistent with the natural salt dust and modeled the salt dust deposition on cotton leaves in this region. (2) The main salt cations on the surface and inside the cotton leaves were Na+, Ca2+, Cl- and SO4 2-, while the amounts of CO3 - and HCO3 - were low. From the analysis, we can order the quantity of the salt cations and anions ions present on the surface and inside the cotton leaves as Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+ and Cl->SO4 2->HCO3 ->CO3 -, respectively. Furthermore, the five salt dust treatment groups in terms of the total salt ions on both the surface and inside the cotton leaves were A(500g.m-2)>B(400g.m-2)>C(300g.m-2)>D(200g.m-2)>E(100g.m-2)>F(0g.m-2). (3)The salt dust that landed on the surface of the cotton leaves can significantly influence the photosynthetic traits of Pn, PE, Ci, Ti, Gs, Tr, WUE, Ls, φ, Amax, k and Rady of the cotton leaves. (4)Salt dust can significantly damage the physiological functions of the cotton leaves, resulting in a decrease in leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content, and increasing cytoplasmic membrane permeability and malondialdehyde (MDA) content by increasing the soluble sugar and proline to adjust for the loss of the cell cytosol. This increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes to eliminate harmful materials, such as the intracellular reactive oxygen and MDA, thus reducing the damage caused by the salt dust and maintaining normal physiological functioning. Overall, this work found that the salt dust deposition was a problem for the crop and the salt dust could significantly influence the physiological and biochemical processes of the cotton leaves. This will eventually damage the leaves and reduce the cotton production, leading to agricultural economic loss. Therefore, attention should be paid to salt dust storms in the Ebinur Basin and efficient measures should be undertaken to protect the environment.

25970440|t|Introduction
25970440|a|

25970440|t|Salt dust storms are extreme weather phenomena that primarily originate from wind erosion of dried up salt ion rich lake sediments (Fig 1) [–]. These salt dust storms differ from the typical sand storms in that they contain a high density of very small particles of sulfate, chloride, pesticide dust and harmful heavy metals, including Pb, Cu, Cr, Hg and Zn [–]. The frequent occurrence of salt dust storms within the Ebinur Basin has led to a large amount of scattering of saline dust to the surrounding areas, which can cause desertification of lakesides and plains, damage vegetation and catalyze the formation of new desert []. Salt dust is also a serious air pollutant that is very harmful to human health. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of salt dust storms in the Ebinur Basin has negatively impacted railway traffic, even necessitating suspension of railway service [,–]. In agriculture, the salt dust pollution can affect soil quality, available soil nutrients and minerals, organic matter, pH and amount of clay [–]. Salt dust storms can also significantly influence plant height, root length and seed germination rate, and cause changes in root, stem and leaf morphology, such as a decrease in fresh weight [,,,].

25970440|t|When salt dust lands on plant leaves, the leaf surface becomes covered, which captures the plant’s moisture and blocks the stomata, respiration and photosynthesis that normally occurs. This salt dust covering shades the leaves from radiation from the sun, affects photosynthesis and leaf reflectance, increases the leaf temperature, affects the surface humidity, gas exchange and assimilation of the blades, and influences pollination [,,]. This can result in degeneration in the plant’s ability to function, decreasing the biomass and yield and, thus, causing serious agricultural economic loss [,].

25970440|t|Previous studies have tended to focus on plants in high and low temperatures, drought, stress caused by cement and fly ash dust, and crops including wheat, cotton, corn and vegetables. The studied parameters included amount of leaf chlorophyll, changes in leaf cell structure, blade internal physiological indexes of cytoplasm membrane permeability, MDA content, active oxygen changes, and substances involved in osmotic regulation, such as proline, betaine and soluble sugar, and antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT). However, there have been no reports concerning the impact of salt dust on cotton crops, including on the salt ion distribution on the cotton leaves, and the internal and structural changes to the cotton leaf under salt dust deposition.

25970440|t|Xinjiang is China's major cotton producing region, and is worldwide famous for its high quality cotton production []. The Ebinur Basin is located in the south of the famous Alataw Pass in Northwest China. In this region, the wind speed can be greater than 8 m.s-1 up to 164 days of the year with a maximum instantaneous wind speed of 55 ms-1 throughout the year [,]. Since the 1950s, the development of industrial and agricultural production in the Ebinur Basin has resulted in large quantities of water resources being used for irrigation without a corresponding increase in the amount of precipitation. This has led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of water in Ebinur from 1200 km2 to 500 km2, lowering the water level of the lake and drying up areas. This dried bare lake bottom has caused serious ecological problems in this basin [,,,]. The loose sediment at the bottom of the dry lake is rich in salt ions that are susceptible to wind erosion at wind speeds as low as 4.3–6.4 m.s- 1. The strong winds from Alataw Pass can easily blow about this loose sediment and spread the salt dust (particle size often 2–63 μm as measured by Liu et al. []. This salt dust can cause a disastrous salt storm and can be transported up to thousands of kilometers away. The Ebinur Basin is a famous salt dust source in Northwest China and central Asia [,].

25970440|t|Since the 1970s, the frequent occurrence of salt dust storms in the Ebinur Basin has seriously harmed the surrounding environment. Amounts this high of salt dust have damaged the vegetation, reduced agricultural production, desertified grassland and the surrounding lake plain, and accelerated the formation of new desert. However, current studies still fail to assess the impact of salt dust storms on agriculture, including on the main crop of the Ebinur Basin and arid regions, cotton. Simulation experiments were used in this work to study the influence of salt dust on the salt content of the cotton leaves, particle size distribution, photosynthesis, leaf blade cell structure, amounts of chlorophyll, proline, soluble sugar and MDA, and antioxidant enzyme activity. From this, we can provide a scientific basis for studying the salt dust storms in this region and other similar regions around the world, and then take proper measures to protect the environment.

25970440|t|Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition
25970440|a|

25970440|t|The sample collection and test were all permitted in our country and no specific permissions were required for these locations/activities, we confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. The salt dust for the experiments was obtained from the Alataw Pass in Xinjiang in Northwest China as follows. First, loose saline soil was broken up and ground up, then pushed through a fine screen (0.02 mm). Then, under windless and sunny conditions on June 6th, 2013, we ran an artificial simulation of salt dust deposition consisting of five salt dust spray gradients of 0 g.m-2, 100 g.m-2, 200 g.m-2, 300 g.m-2, 400 g.m-2 and 500 g.m-2 in the cotton fields in the southwest of Jinghe county in the Ebinur Basin, China (Fig 2), and four-replication groups of each salt dust simulated level were settled.

25970440|t|After allowing the experiment to run for 15 days (June 21th, 2013), the salt dust that had landed on the cotton leaves was collected. From this, the particle sizes, composition of the salt ions on the surface and inside the leaves, and photosynthesis of the leaves (using parameters of the net photosynthetic rate (P n), light use efficiency (PE), intercellular CO2 concentration (C i), leaf temperature (T i), stomatal conductance (G s), transpiration rate (T r), water use efficiency (WUE), limiting value of stomata (L s) and the light response) were all measured and each value was chosen as the average of four-replication groups of each salt dust simulated level.

25970440|t|The WUE was calculated as the ratio of the net photosynthetic rate (P n) and the T r. The limiting value of the stomata (L s) was calculated as C a-C i/C a×100%, in which C a is the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and C i is the intercellular CO2 concentration. From there, we calculated the light response parameters of the cotton leaves each day.

25970440|t|To determine the particle size of the salt dust on the cotton leaves, the following steps were taken. First, 30% hydrogen peroxide was added at 72°C to remove any organic matter from the salt dust, which had been collected from the surface cotton leaves in the monitoring area using a fine wool brush. We added hydrochloric acid to remove the carbonate, then ultrapure water to dilute the solution and let it stand for 30 min to remove the supernatant acid. Next, quieted it over and over again until the pH reached 6.5–7.0. Finally, we added sodium hexametaphosphate after 30 min of ultrasound dispose, we used a Mastersizer 2000 (Melvin laser particle size analyzer, USA) with a range of 0.02–2.000 μm to measure the particle sizes of the salt dust.

25970440|t|The photosynthesis of the cotton leaves was measured on a sunny day from 10:00–20:00. The test equipment was a Li-6400 portable photosynthesis measuring system (Li-Cor, Lincon, NE, USA). The tested indicators of photosynthesis were the P n, PE, C i, T l, G s, L s, T r and WUE. During the test, each of the above parameters was tested three times for each sediment group per hour from 10:00 to 20:00, and each value of them was chosen as the average of the four-replication groups of each salt dust simulated level (from 0 g.m-2 to 500 g.m-2). We then calculated the average value of these three values to obtain the final test value. Next, the L s and WUE of the cotton leaves were calculated as (C a-C i)/C a×100% and P n/T r, respectively.

The water-soluble anions consisted mainly of Cl- and SO4 2-, which were 53.94%, while CO3 2- and HCO3 - were only 2.97%. Measuring the particle size of the salt dust that landed on the surface cotton leaves (Fig 3b) showed that for the salt dust that had a total mass of 389 g.kg-1, the main salt cations were Na+ and Ca2+ (34.9%), the water-soluble anions were mainly Cl- and SO4 2-,(45.94%), and the salt ions of Mg2+ and K+ were 14.13%. The particles sized 1.02–58 microns, the silty sand fraction, made up 69.48%, less than 4 microns made up 12.5%, and more than 58 microns made up 27.02%. Overall, these data indicate that the salt dusts used for experiments reflected the natural salt dust found on the cotton plants in the region of interest.

25970440|t|(2) By using the Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) (ZEISS SUPRA55 VP, Germany), we observed that the stomata of the cotton leaves were labiate with a long axis and a short axis (Fig 4d, 4e and 4f). The particle size range of the salt dust that landed on the cotton leaves was predominantly 0–30 μm (Fig 4a, 4b and 4c) with a width of 1–6 μm. SEM also showed that the length of the stomata of the cotton leaves was mainly 6–12 μm and the width was 1.5–3.5 μm, demonstrating that the salt dust within this size range can easily fall into the stomata. These data also show that the shape of the dust widely varies, and when salt dust within this range lands on the surface of the cotton leaves and covers the blade, it can form a covered area that influences the physiological functions of the cotton leaves, including photosynthesis and cellular respiration, and elements such as salt ions may increase the salt content in the cotton leaves. Thus the internal physiological functions of the cotton leaves can be influenced as well, leading to damage to the cotton leaves.

25970440|t|Proline is one of the most widely distributed osmotic substances, and, under stress, the plants increase the synthesis and decrease the degradation. This result in an accumulation of a large amount of proline in the plant body that can help adjust the osmotic balance and reduce the harm to the plants caused by osmotic stress by scavenging free radicals and protecting the plant cell structure [].

25970440|t|Discussion
25970440|a|

25970440|t|By testing the salt ion content, it was determined that the composition and sizes of the particles in the salt dust were similar to the physical and the chemical properties of the natural salt dust as described by Liu et al. [] and Jilili and Mu []. This indicates the salt dust used in these experiments reflects the natural salt dust found on cotton leaves in the region of interest. Using SEM imaging, it was seen the salt dust sedimentation covered an area on the cotton leaves and directly affected photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and stomatal conductance. Furthermore, the smaller particles in the salt dust could fall into the stomata of the cotton leaves, directly conveying the salt ions and other elements, such as heavy metals, into the plant leaves, and increasing the salt ions inside the cotton leaves. Work by Micklin [] found that the dust can cover areas on plant leaves, which can cause a significant decrease in photosynthesis by the cotton leaves. McTainsh and Strong [] determined that tiny dust particles can cover plant leaf stomata specifically and, thereby, affect foliar respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration in the plant leaves. A study by Gao et al. [] showed that after dust fell into the plant stomata, salt ions within the salt dust entered the plant and joined into the plant nutrient cycle, thus increasing the Na+ and Cl- content inside the plant leaves. Previous work revealed that, if the salt ions forming the dust on the surface of the plant leaves reach a threshold value inside the plant leaves, ions are produced that poison the plants and harm plant normal physiological functions, thus influencing plant growth and development.

25970440|t|From the analysis performed in this work, we determined the order of the salt ions inside the cotton leaves of the control and five salt dust treatment groups: Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+, while the order of the salt anions on the surface and inside the cotton leaves was Cl->SO4 2->HCO3 ->CO3 -. It was found that in this work, due to their high permeability, Na+ on the surface of the cotton leaves was the large contributor to the salt ion content inside the cotton leaves []. This is in contrast to the high amount of K+ on the surface of the cotton leaves, yet little K+ inside the cotton leaves [,]. According to work done by Tuerxun et al. [], when the soil supply is deficient in potassium, there will be a low concentration of K+ in the plant cells. In order to maintain normal cell turgor pressure and functioning of the plant, Na+ contained within the plants can partially make up for the lack of K+ and relieve the symptoms of potassium deficiency, suggesting an accumulation of Na+ inside the leaves. Previous research has shown that K+ ions have low permeability, therefore, when salt dust lands on the surface of the cotton leaves, it enters inside the cotton leaf at a lower rate than the Na+ ions. This also indicates the K+ inside the leaves may come from the soil after being absorbed by the cotton plant roots [,].

25970440|t|By comparison, Cl- and SO4 2- can be easily absorbed by the cotton leaves [,,–]. In this study, we also found a higher content of Cl- inside the cotton leaves that came from salt dust settling on the surface of the cotton leaves. Additionally, Cl- may come from the soil when absorbed by the cotton plant roots and transferred to the leaves. This may explain why in this study some of the cotton leaves turned yellow in the 500 g.m-2 salt dust deposition group. The high content of Na+ and Cl- absorbed by the roots from the soil and salt dust on the surface of the cotton leaves accumulated and turned the plant leaves yellow, which is consistent with previous research [,,,].

25970440|t|Plant leaf photosynthesis is very sensitive to environmental changes [–] and can be influenced by many environmental factors, such as light intensity, temperature, moisture and salt stress [,–]. Salt dust deposition poses a challenge to the plant. Previous work has shown that when a certain amount of substance landed on the plant surface, plant photosynthesis was affected [,,]. In this work, we determined that salt dust can have a significant impact on the physiological characteristics of cotton, and, compared to the control, there were significant changes in the photosynthetic characteristics indexes of P n, PE, C i T i, G s, L s, T r and WUE of the cotton leaves, as well as in K, φ, A max and R ady in the cotton leaves from the salt dust treated groups. Many studies have found that an increase in salt ion content in the sand and dust that landed on the surface of the plant leaves causes a decreae in most of the physiological indexes, such as P n, G s, L s, C i, PE, K, φ and A max [,,,,]. In this work, compared with the control, there was an increased effect on the photosynthetic traits of the cotton leaves as the salt dust treatment increased, which was even obvious between the five salt dust groups. Observations made during the experiments found that there were yellow cottons leaves in the five salt dust treatment groups, indicating the salt dust not only influenced the cotton’s photosynthetic abilities, but also the internal physical properties of the cotton leaves [,].

25970440|t|The blades are the source organs of the plants, and undertake the substance production that supplies the whole plant. They also have a significant influence on the growth and development of the crops. Previous research has shown that when dust landed on the plant leaves it can form an adhesive layer that can seal the stoma and hinder the respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration of the plant. In this work, we found that in the salt dust treated groups, the respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration of the cotton leaves decreased. In comparison to the control group, the stomatal conductance and limitation of the cotton leaves of the salt dust treated groups all decreased, indicating a decrease in the respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration of the cotton leaves from this. Chen et al. [] measured the physiological and ecological responses of 22 plants to the dust and found that in some plants, the rate of plant transpiration dropped significantly, while it significantly rose in others due to the adaptation of the plant leaves to the dust in a short period of time. In this study, we found that when the cotton leaves suffered from salt dust deposition, the respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration of the cotton leaves all decreased, which likely reflects the adaptation of the cotton leaves to the salt dust stress in a short period of time. Because landing of salt dust on the surface of the cotton blade can block the absorption of CO2 by cotton stomata, there is a reduction in the stomatal conductivity that will eventually influence respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration of the cotton leaves.

25970440|t|The total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of the cotton leaves plays an important role in the photosynthesis of the plants and will influence the normal growth and productivity. Studies performed both at home and abroad have shown that the total chlorophyll and carotenoid content decreased when the plant suffered from stresses such as drought, salinity, and low and high temperatures [,,,]. Work by Pandey and Sinha [] found that the total chlorophyll content significantly decreased when the maize leaves encountered coal smoke pollution. This also occurs in wheat leaves when they undergo cement dust deposition. Work by Migahid et al. [] found that cement dust deposition can result in a significant reduction in the total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of soybean leaves. In this work we found that salt dust deposition on cotton leaves led to a decrease in the total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of the cotton leaves. This is consistent with the above described research, indicating that salt dust deposition significantly influences the photosynthesis of cotton leaves, which will eventually influence cotton production.

25970440|t|Carbohydrates are important components of plants. Soluble sugar is the primary product of photosynthesis in higher plants and it can form the starch, fat, protein, fiber and other compounds found in the plant. It can also maintain the carbon and nitrogen metabolism during the growth period of plant. Furthermore, it is in the class of cell osmotic regulation substances, and, therefore, plays a significant role in plant growth and development. Previous research has shown that when plants suffer from salt stress, arid conditions or freezing, the soluble sugar content of the plants will increase [,]. In this work, we found that compared to the control group, the soluble sugar content of the cotton leaves in the salt dust treated groups increased as the salt dust deposition led to the increase in sugar content was more significantly. In this work, Na+, Cl-, and SO4 2- within the salt dust landing on the surface of the cotton leaves strongly contributed to the salt ion content inside the cotton leaves. This resulted in stress from the salt ions on the cotton leaves and led to water loss in the cotton cells through an increase in the soluble sugar content to adjust the osmotic potential in an effort to maintain normal physiological functioning of the cells.

25970440|t|Currently, research on the influence of stresses on the cytoplasm membrane structure and function of the plant often focus on increasing MDA content, which is directly related to the degree of injury to the plant cells. In this work, in comparison to the groups that weren’t exposed to salt dust, the leaves exposed to salt dust had an increased MDA content, suggesting the salt dust deposition significantly damaged the cells of the cotton leaves. This led to the production of harmful substances, such as the reactive oxygen species (O2 -, OH-, H2O, OH-, etc.) in the blade cells, which can cause membrane lipid peroxidation, thus destroying the membrane structure of the plant cells. A number of studies have shown that in cases of stress, such as that from salt, drought or high temperature, the MDA content of the plant cells will increase through enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activity to remove the harmful material of reactive oxygen species to reduce the negative influence on plant cell functioning [,]. In this work, we found that compared to the control group, the antioxidant enzymes of SOD, POD and CAT were increased in the salt dust treatment groups. This shows that the salt dust deposition was a stress just like drought, high and low temperatures, and can damage the plant cells and raise the MDA content by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes to remove reactive oxygen species. This is consistent with published work.

25970440|t|This work found that when salt dust landed on the surface of cotton leaves, it impacted the photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration of the cotton leaves, which then affected physiological and biochemical processes, such as nutrient absorption, and chlorophyll and carotenoid content. This can also destroy the structure of the cotton leaves cells, and increase the MDA content of the cotton leaves by increasing osmotic adjustment substances, such as proline and soluble sugar, to reduce cytosolic extravasation. There is also an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as the SOD, POD and CAT, to remove reactive oxygen and MDA in the cotton leaves to maintain normal functioning of the cotton leaves.

25970440|t|Over the past 50 years with the rapid land-use changes in the Ebinur Basin, man has significantly affected and modified the natural landscape of this area. These changes increased as the population density increased and agriculture intensified [,]. The conversion of land into that used for agriculture, and other driving forces of land-use changes are the leading factors behind the excessive use of water resources in this area, which resulted in a significant reduction in the surface water resources that flow into the Ebinur [,]. Overall, in the water area of the Ebinur to the remaining 500 square kilometers that resulted in a large bared area of dry lake bottom. This dry lake bottom has become a huge salt dust storm source in Northwest China and Central Asia [,,,]. These areas face the serious threat of the salt dust storms. In order to protect the environment and reduce the effect of the salt dust storms on agriculture and economy, we should pay increased attention to these phenomena and take efficient protective measures in this area.

25970440|a|

25970440|t|The salt ion content, composition and particle size of the salt dust used in these experiments were similar to those of natural salt dust, suggesting the salt dust on the cotton leaves was from salt dust storms in this region.

25970440|t|The primary salt cations on the surface and inside the cotton leaves were Na+, Ca2+, Cl- and SO4 2-, while the CO3 - and HCO3 - contents were present only at low levels. Overall, the salt cation and anion content on the surface and inside the cotton leaves can be ordered as Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+ and Cl->SO4 2->HCO3 ->CO3 -, respectively. There were significant differences in the Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, SO4 2-, HCO3 - and CO3 - found on the surface and inside the cotton leaves of the salt dust treated groups compared to the control, but the differences varied between salt dust groups. Both Na+ and Cl- found on the surface of the leaves contributed strongly to the amount inside the cotton leaves. Overall, the five salt dust treatment groups are ordered according to total amount of salt ions on the surface and inside the cotton leaves as: 500 g.m-2>400 g.m-2>300 g.m-2>200 g.m-2>100 g.m-2.

25970440|t|The salt dust that lands on the surface of cotton leaves can significantly influence the photosynthetic traits of P n, PE, C i T i, G s, T r, WUE, L s, φ, A max, k, and R ady of the cotton leaves, as the differences between the control and the groups treated with salt dust groups were significant. However, differences between the five salt dust groups varied.

25970440|t|Salt dust can significantly hinder the physiological functions of cotton leaves, such as causing a decrease in leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content, and increasing cytoplasmic membrane permeability and the MDA content. The MDA content is increased by increasing the soluble sugar and proline content to adjust for the loss of the cytosol in the cells, the activity of antioxidant enzymes to eliminate harmful molecules, such as intracellular reactive oxygen species, in an effort to reduce the damage caused by salt dust stress and maintain normal physiological functions. As a whole, salt dust deposition is a hardship for the cotton crops, which is consistent with previously published work concerning the effect of salt dust on other plants.

25970440|t|Isolation technology should be used to limit the perennial water deposition and dry lake area with the goals of returning farmland to forests, grassland and lake to stabilize and increase the water area of the Ebinur, as well as curb the source of the sand in this area.
25970440|a|

25970440|t|Biological control techniques should be used to cultivate salt tolerant shrubs and trees, such as Saxoul, Tamarix, and Populus euphratica, in order to decrease the uptake of the salt dust from the dry salt bottom of the lake and the threat of wind erosion in this basin.

25970440|t|Strict water management systems should be implemented to reduce the irresponsible use and waste of water resources in the river basin. Specifically, the use of water resources from the Bortala and Jing rivers, which are the main rivers feeding into Ebinur, should be reduced. The exploitation of groundwater in this area should be reduced and precipitation should be artificially enhanced to maintain the water resources in this area and water levels of the lake.
25970440|a|

25970440|t|New agricultural techniques, such as plastic membrane mulching and drip irrigation, should be used, especially in cotton fields, to improve the use of the limited water resources, and to raise the price lever of the water resources used by industry. Furthermore, industrial projects, such as coal and silicon chemical enterprises, should be restricted as they can be harmful to the natural environment.

25970440|t|The Ebinur Basin should be established as a nature reserve in order to strength the soil and water conservation and afforestation, strengthen management of the Ebinur Basin, prohibit deforestation, rotten dig herbs and exploitation of the grassland, and ensure the normal growth and natural regeneration of the natural vegetation, predominantly Sacsaoul forest. These measures should reduce the negative influence of the sand from the dried bottom of the Ebinur Basin and, thus, protect the natural environment.
25970440|a|

25970440|t|Measures should be taken to recover the crop output of crops after damage from the salt dust in the area, such as enhancing the fertilizer with N, P, and K to improve the absorption of the nutrients from the soil and increasing the amount of irrigation, to promote crop productivity and reduce damage to the economy.

26133372|t|N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in rat kidney reduces renal perfusion and ultrafiltration. Hypoperfusion-induced ischemia is the most frequent cause of functional insufficiency in the endotoxemic kidney. Here, we used non-hypotensive rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia to examine whether NMDA receptor hyperfunction contributes to acute kidney injury. Lipopolysaccharide-induced renal damage via increased enzymuria and hemodynamic impairments were ameliorated by co-treatment with the NMDA receptor blocker, MK-801. The NMDA receptor NR1 subunit in the rat kidney mainly co-localized with serine racemase, an enzyme responsible for synthesizing the NMDA receptor co-agonist, D-serine. The NMDA receptor hyperfunction in lipopolysaccharide-treated kidneys was demonstrated by NR1 and serine racemase upregulation, particularly in renal tubules, and by increased D-serine levels. Lipopolysaccharide also induced cell damage in cultured tubular cell lines and primary rat proximal tubular cells. This damage was mitigated by MK-801 and by small interfering RNA targeting NR1. Lipopolysaccharide increased cytokine release in tubular cell lines via toll-like receptor 4. The release of interleukin-1β from these cells are the most abundant. An interleukin-1 receptor antagonist not only attenuated cell death but also abolished lipopolysaccharide-induced NR1 and serine racemase upregulation and increases in D-serine secretion, suggesting that interleukin-1β-mediated NMDA receptor hyperfunction participates in lipopolysaccharide-induced tubular damage. The results of this study indicate NMDA receptor hyperfunction via cytokine effect participates in lipopolysaccharide-induced renal insufficiency. Blockade of NMDA receptors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of sepsis-associated renal failure.

26133372|t|Introduction
26133372|a|

26133372|t|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is an ionotropic receptor/calcium channel within the CNS that is activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, to perform critical functions that control synaptic plasticity during learning and memory formation []. The NMDA receptor is also expressed in extraneural tissues including the kidney [–], where its functions are less well-known. Enhanced NMDA receptor function induced by channel overexpression mediates cytotoxicity due to massive calcium influx []. The entry of calcium through NMDA receptors is mainly gated by the NR1 subunit, which forms a tetramer with other modulatory subunits []. Different NMDA receptor subunits are present in the glomeruli, arterioles, and tubules of the rat kidney [–]. In addition, the glutamate recognition site on the NR1 subunit, D-serine, is thought to bind stereo-selectively to the glycine-regulatory site. The effects on NMDA receptor activation in motor neurons are either equal to or 100-fold more potent than those of glycine []; thus D-serine may be a physiological co-agonist for receptor activation []. Furthermore, D-serine is endogenously synthesized from L-serine by the enzyme, serine racemase (S-Race) []. We previously showed that S-Race is also present in the rat kidney [], clearly indicating the presence of a complete NMDA receptor system.

26133372|t|The effect of NMDA receptors on renal hemodynamic regulation, however, is unclear. Inhibition of NMDA receptors by systemic application of MK-801 (a channel blocker) and 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (a glycine antagonist) induces renal vasoconstriction and attenuates renal vasodilatory responses to glycine infusion, indicating that renal NMDA receptors act as vasodilators []. We previously showed that direct activation of renal NMDA receptors by intrarenal arterial infusion of NMDA decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine and salt excretion [], indicating that renal NMDA receptors act as vasoconstrictors. Different intensities and durations of NMDA receptor activation may explain the discrepancy between these observations, suggesting that renal NMDA receptors may play a role in hemodynamic regulation. Interestingly, renal NMDA receptor hyperactivity contributes to kidney injury caused by channel overexpression, as demonstrated in disease models utilizing short-term treatment with the nephrotoxic drug gentamicin or ischemia-reperfusion [, ].

26133372|t|Despite recent advances in medical treatment, the overall mortality of sepsis caused by multiple organ failure remains high [–]. Patients with sepsis often suffer acute renal failure [], so identifying molecular targets that will enable effective treatment of sepsis-related kidney dysfunction is therefore of utmost importance. NMDA receptor inhibition attenuates hippocampal neuronal degeneration and reduces inflammation or oxidative stress in intestine, liver, and lung tissues of rat models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia or sepsis [–]. This suggests that NMDA receptor hyperfunction is involved in LPS-induced multiple organ failure. However, it is not known whether NMDA receptors influence LPS-induced renal insufficiency, although we previously showed that LPS impairs renal function via increased inflammatory cytokine release [].

Since NR1 is expressed in porcine kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [], which represent cells of proximal and distal tubule origin, respectively. The direct effect of LPS on these cells and on proximal tubular cells isolated from rat kidneys was also tested as a model of tubular cell damage.

26133372|t|After induction, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg kg-1, i.p.) and underwent surgical preparation for measurement of systemic and renal hemodynamics and urine collection as previously described [, ]. The PE-50 catheter was placed into the left carotid artery for blood sampling and for continuous measurement of the systemic mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). The heart rate (HR) was measured by arterial pulse wave analysis using MP36 AcqKnowledge software (Biopac, Los Angeles, CA). Another catheter was inserted into the left femoral vein to facilitate saline supplementation. The left kidney was exposed via a flank incision and the ureter was cannulated by PE-10 catheter for urine collection. The renal blood flow (RBF) was measured using an ultrasound flow probe (Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY). Regional blood perfusion in the renal cortex of the left kidney, termed cortical microvascular blood flow (CMBF), was monitored using a flowmeter (Transonic Systems). All hemodynamic parameters were continuously recorded and displayed on a monitor. Arterial blood (200 μl) was then sampled for creatinine assays.

Urine volume was estimated gravimetrically to determine the urinary flow rate, and hematocrit was measured by a capillary tube after centrifugation. The inulin concentration in urine and plasma was measured by spectrophotometry, and the GFR was estimated according to inulin clearance. Sodium levels in urine or plasma were measured using flame photometry to determine the excretory rate of sodium and fractional excretion of sodium. Fractional excretion of sodium (%) was calculated as [urinary excretion rate of sodium/(plasma sodium concentration × GFR)] × 100. Renal filtration fraction (%) was calculated as {GFR/[RBF×(1- hematocrit)] ×100}. Urinary levels of protein, α-GST, and μ-GST were measured using commercial kits, as previously described [].

26133372|t|For the in vitro assays, LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells were used as a model of proximal and distal tubule cells, respectively, and rat proximal tubular cells were isolated for use as the primary culture model. LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells were purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Tubular cell lines were originally derived from the American Type Culture Collection lines CL-101 (for LLC-PK1) and CCL-34 (for MDCK). All culture medium and supplements were purchased from Thermo Scientific HyClone (South Logan, UT). LLC-PK1 cells were cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in Medium 199 containing 3% fetal bovine serum, sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g l-1), penicillin (10,000 U ml-1) and streptomycin (10,000 μg ml-1). Cells were subcultured when they reached confluence (approximately every 2–3 days). MDCK cells were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g l-1 sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and the same concentrations of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were treated with PBS, LPS (50 μg ml-1), MK-801 (1 μM), a TLR-4 antagonist (LPS from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, LPS-RS; 20 ng ml-1; Sigma-Aldrich), an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, 10 ng ml-1; Sigma-Aldrich), or a combination of these for 4, 8, or 24 h. Dosing was determined by reference to the IC50 of each antagonist.

Renal cortical tissue was collected with the help of a stereomicroscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Cortical samples were sliced into pieces (~1 mm wide) and digested with tissue dissociation medium containing collagenase and trypsin at 37°C for 30 min with stirring. The suspension was then filtered through a sieve with a mesh size of 80 μm. The cells were collected from the sieve after centrifugation and then suspended in basal culture medium containing fibroblast growth inhibitor, rat epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated at an appropriate cell density in a collagen-coated dish and then cultured at 37°C/5% CO2. The culture medium was changed after 24 h to remove nonadherent cells and residual cellular fragments. After 5 days, the cell cultures with 80% of confluent were treated with LPS or siRNA.

Renal tissues, brain cortex, and cell pellets were homogenized in ice-cold distilled water, and the supernatant of homogenized samples and culture medium were collected for use in the assay. The protein concentration in sample was determined using a colorimetric assay kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Glutaraldehyde (25 μl) was added to 100 μl of each extract (containing 1 mg ml-1 sample protein) or to 100 μl of a D-serine standard (0.01–10 nM) in PBS containing 0.2 mg ml-1 BSA. The D-serine standard solutions and samples containing glutaraldehyde were mixed thoroughly, and 50 μl of this solution was added to a 96-well plate in duplicate. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed with PBS containing Tween 20 (PBST) and air dried. Blocking buffer (2% nonfat milk in PBST; 50 μl) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The plates were then washed three times in PBST (300 μl per well). A D-serine-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was diluted 1:1,000 in PBST containing 1% BSA. Fifty microliters of this solution was then added to each well and incubated for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBST. A horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added for 30 min, followed by three washes in PBST. A solution of 2,2'-azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt (50 μl, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the resulting colorimetric reaction was measured at 405 nm. The amount of D-serine in sample was expressed as nmole per mg of protein.

26133372|t|Semi-quantitative or real-time RT-PCR was used to detect NR1 or S-Race mRNA expression, as previously described []. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 10 μg of total RNA and amplified, as previously described (8). The NR1 primer sequences for conventional PCR were as follows: 5’-ACG GAA TGA TGG GCG AGC-3’ (sense) and 5’-GGC ATC CTT GTG TCG CTT GTA G-3’ (antisense) (transcript product, 1,033 bp; NM_017010). The S-Race primers were as follows: 5’-CCC AAA GCC GTT GTT ACT CAC A-3’ (sense) and 5’-CAT TGG AAG GTT CAG CAG CGT ACA-3’ (antisense) (395 bp; NM_198757). Actin primers were as follows: 5’-TCA GGT CAT CAC TAT CGG G-3’ (sense) and 5’-CAG TAA TCT CCT TCT GCA TC-3’ (antisense) (221 bp; NM_031144.3). PCR began with a denaturation step of 1 min at 94°C followed by 40 cycles for NR1, S-Race, and actin at 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The densities of the bands were measured using an image analytic system (Diagnostic Instruments), and mRNA levels are expressed as the ratio of NR1 or S-Race to actin. The primer sequences for real-time RT-PCR were listed in S1 Table. The comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method was used to quantify NR1 mRNA levels. The calculation used was: ΔΔCT = [CT NR1 (unknown sample)—CT GAPDH (unknown sample)]—[CT NR1 (calibrator sample)—CT GAPDH (calibrator sample)]. The cDNA of calibrator sample was obtained from rat brain cortex.

26133372|t|Indirect immunofluorescent staining was used to examine the cellular distribution of FLK-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NR1, or S-Race and their co-localization in renal tissues or tubular cells, as described previously []. Briefly, postfixed kidneys were stored in 10% sucrose prepared in 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4°C, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Torrence, CA), and frozen at –20°C, and then cut into 5 μm sections on a cryostat (Microm, Heidelberg, Germany), which were thaw-mounted on coated slides. Cells were cultured on poly-D-lysine-precoated glass dishes and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4°C for 2 h. After being rehydrated and washed with PBS, tissue sections and culture dishes were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a tyramide signal amplification kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). After being blocked with 5% skimmed milk prepared in PBS for 1 h, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with an anti-NR1 antibody and then for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with the corresponding cyanine 3-conjugated secondary antibody. After detection of NR1, tissue sections or culture dishes were incubated overnight at 4°C with an anti-S-Race or anti-FLK-1 antibody, and then for 1 h at RT with the corresponding fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody, and examined on an inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a fluorescence image analytic system (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).

26133372|t|Compared with the control group, LPS increased plasma creatinine levels at 24 and 48 h (Fig 1) and this was associated with increased urinary protein excretion at all time-points (P < 0.05). Moreover, LPS significantly increased urinary excretion of the specific tubular markers, α-glutathione S-transferase (α-GST, a proximal tubular cell marker of cytoplasmic leakage) and μ-GST (a distal tubular cell marker), at 4–48 h and at 24–48 h, respectively. Body weight, left kidney weight, hematocrit, and plasma sodium concentration were similar for all groups (S2 Table). MK-801 reduced LPS-induced increases in plasma creatinine, with a significant effect observed at 48 h. MK-801 also abrogated LPS-induced enzymuria.

26133372|t|Detection of NR1 and S-Race expression in renal tissues
26133372|a|

26133372|t|LPS caused a gradual and time-dependent increase in NR1 expression in the renal cortex and medulla (Fig 3A). By contrast, LPS caused an abrupt increase in S-Race expression after 8 h of treatment, which remained high thereafter. Immunostaining identified NR1 in the endothelial lining of renal vessels (marked by FLK-1, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, Fig 3B) and at the apical membrane of the proximal tubules and collecting ducts, with a more limited distribution in the glomeruli of control kidneys (Fig 3C). S-Race was mostly localized in the renal tubules, although there was some expression in the renal vessels. No signal was observed in the glomeruli. NR1 mainly co-localized with S-Race. Compared with that in the control group, there was a marked increase in the NR1 signal in the tubules and vessels in LPS48-treated kidneys; however, increased S-Race expression was only observed in tubules in which NR1 was also present. LPS treatment also increased the expression of NR1 and S-Race mRNA (Fig 3D).

26133372|t|LPS-induced cytotoxicity in tubular cells was examined in a LDH release assay (Fig 4A). LPS induced a gradual increase in LDH release from both LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells, and from a primary culture of rat proximal tubular cells. LPS-induced LDH release was markedly attenuated by MK-801. MK-801 alone had no effect on LDH release. In the absence of LPS, rat proximal tubular cells showed the typical cobblestone appearance of a normal epithelial cell monolayer (Fig 4B). When the cells were exposed to LPS for 24 h, a number of cells became swollen and enlarged, a typical feature of necrosis. LPS increased the expression of both NR1 and S-Race in all tested cells (Fig 4C). The increase in NR1 expression in LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells was gradual (over 24 h), whereas S-Race expression peaked after 4 h of treatment and remained high thereafter. Immunocytostaining revealed the presence of NR1 and S-Race in untreated LLC-PK1 cells, with co-localization of most signals (Fig 4D). We next determined whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NR1 could silence the LPS-mediated upregulation of NR1. LPS significantly increased NR1 expression at mRNA and protein levels and LDH release in all tested cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig 4E). NR1 silencing alone showed no effect on NR1 mRNA expression but reduced NR1 protein expression in LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells. Both mRNA and protein expression of NR1 in cells treated with NR1 siRNA followed by LPS was reduced to levels lowered or similar to that in control cells, and these were associated with a reduction in LPS-induced LDH release.

LPS treatment increased renal D-serine levels, with a maximal response observed after 8 h. D-serine was detected in cell lysates and culture medium from the tubular cell lines (Fig 5B). LPS treatment led to increases in intracellular D-serine and D-serine levels in the culture medium (all P<0.05), indicating its de novo synthesis and subsequent release.

26133372|t|Cytokine effects in tubular cells
26133372|a|

26133372|t|The LPS receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), was detected in both cell lines with higher expression in MDCK cells than LLC-PK1 cells (Fig 6A). LPS increased the release of IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α in a time-dependent manner with peak expression around 4–8 h (Fig 6B). The increase in LPS-induced IL-1β release was the most prominent among the cytokines examined, especially in the LLC-PK1 cell line. Treatment with the TLR4 antagonist, LPS-RS, for 8 h markedly attenuated LPS-induced IL-1β release in LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells (Fig 6C). Co-treatment of both cell lines with LPS and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) led to a significant reduction in LPS-induced cytotoxicity (by 79 ± 8% and 59 ± 6%, respectively) through suppressed LDH release (Fig 6D). In addition to reducing cytotoxicity, IL-1Ra also attenuated LPS-mediated increases in NR1 and S-Race expression in both cell lines (Fig 6E). Treatment of MDCK cells with IL-1Ra alone also reduced the expression of NR1. Interestingly, IL-1Ra abrogated the LPS-induced de novo synthesis and release of D-serine in both cell lines (Fig 6F).

26133372|a|

26133372|t|As summarized in the schematic shown in Fig 7, this study provides novel evidence demonstrating that NMDA receptor hyperfunction contributes to acute renal failure during LPS-induced endotoxemia. LPS induced IL-1β release and caused upregulation of NR1 and S-Race, leading to NMDA receptor over-activation in tubular cells via S-Race-derived D-serine production and secretion. The poor renal perfusion and ultrafiltration in LPS-treated kidneys was due to the vasoconstrictor effects of D-serine on NMDA receptors. Inhibition of NMDA receptors attenuated LPS-induced functional deterioration and tubular cell damage in in vivo and in vitro.

26133372|t|LPS binds to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and induces interleukin (IL)-1β release from tubular cells. TLR4 and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling in tubular cells increases expression of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit and serine racemase. Upregulation of NR1 and serine racemase, together with increased D-serine levels, results in NMDA receptor hyperfunction. NMDA receptor hyperfunction in LPS causes tubular cell damage and poor renal perfusion through vasoconstriction leading to acute renal failure.

26133372|t|Disturbances in systemic hemodynamic function during endotoxemia invariably lead to multiple organ failure due to inadequate tissue perfusion [, ]. The dose of LPS given in this study caused a significant reduction in renal perfusion but not in systemic arterial pressure (Fig 2). This is in agreement with previous results from a conscious rat model, which show that LPS decreases glomerular ultrafiltration without eliciting a reduction in blood pressure []. However, the apparent lack of any effect on blood pressure may be a compensatory result of tachycardia (Fig 2), which is caused by baroreceptor reflex-mediated sympathetic activation in response to LPS-mediated vasodilation []. Interestingly, NMDA receptors have been identified in (and are functionally present in) neural pathways involved in the reflex control of blood pressure and heart rate [, ]. We speculate that LPS may stimulate NMDA receptors within the CNS pathways that mediates tachycardia.

26133372|t|A previous in vitro study demonstrated that LPS selectively induces vasoconstriction in the renal artery, but not in the superior mesenteric artery, by impairing acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation in rats []. In this study, NMDA receptor inhibition prevented reductions in renal perfusion and ameliorated decline in ultrafiltration (Fig 2) but not NR1 expression (S2 Fig), indicating that NMDA receptor hyperfunction contributes to renal vasoconstriction in endotoxemic kidneys. This is consistent with our previous findings that direct activation of NMDA receptors (via intrarenal arterial administration of NMDA) reduced the GFR in a dose-dependent manner []; however, acute administration of NMDA had no effect on renal blood flow, which was decreased by LPS. The LPS-induced NMDA receptor upregulation in disease states may explain this difference. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hyperfunction in renal injury is well established. Expression of both renal NR1 protein and mRNA is upregulated during ischemia-reperfusion insult and by short-term treatment with gentamicin [, ], as well as in the endotoxemic model reported herein.

26133372|t|In addition to regulating renal vascular tone, the presence of NMDA receptors in renal tubules possibly might affect tubular reabsorption [, , ]. The immunostaining results presented herein support this view because NR1 was identified in both the proximal and distal tubules (Fig 3). We did not examine how LPS and NMDA receptors affect tubular transport. However, NMDA receptor blockade prevented sodium-wasting caused by LPS (Fig 2). Moreover, LPS enhances enzymuria of tubular markers in vivo and increases tubular cytotoxicity in vitro (Figs 1 and 4A), suggesting tubular cell damage or loss could be one of the mechanisms underlying salt-wasting after LPS treatment. The mechanism underlying LPS-mediated tubular damage is dependent on NMDA receptor hyperfunction because cell damage was ameliorated by MK-801 and NR1 silencing (Fig 4). Our hypothesis that LPS causes NMDA receptor hyperfunction is further supported by the observation that LPS upregulates NR1 and S-Race expression, and also by increases in D-serine levels in the rat kidney and in cultured tubular cells. Interestingly, the temporal changes in NR1 and S-Race expression observed in LPS-treated tubular cell cultures were similar to those observed in rat kidneys, indicating that most of the LPS-induced increases in protein expression were of tubular origin.

26133372|t|High plasma levels of D-serine are nephrotoxic because D-serine can be reabsorbed by straight segments of the proximal tubules, which causes tubular cell necrosis [–]. D-serine taken up by tubular cells is metabolized by an intracellular enzyme, D-amino acid oxidase, which generates reactive oxygen species via the depletion of reduced glutathione, thereby contributing to tubular damage []. It is not known whether there is an increase in plasma D-serine in LPS-treated animals; however, increased levels of D-serine in renal tissues (Fig 5) suggest a direct toxic effect on the kidney. This suggestion is supported by the de novo synthesis and release of D-serine by cultured tubular cells during LPS-mediated tubular cell damage (Fig 5). Since D-serine acts as an endogenous ligand for the NMDA receptor, and NR1 is present in renal tubules [, ], we speculate that D-serine-induced nephrotoxicity may be the result of NMDA receptor over-stimulation, as demonstrated by previous studies [–]. Whether the D-serine-mediated effects on NMDA receptor function influence nephrotoxicity warrants further study.

26133372|t|The LPS receptor, TLR4, is expressed in murine kidneys and shows a largely tubular distribution [, ]. TLR4 was also expressed in the tubular cell lines used herein, and its expression was higher in MDCK cells than in LLC-PK1 cells at the same amount of protein loading (Fig 6). It is therefore possible that MDCK cells may be more responsive to LPS than LLC-PK1 cells. However, LLC-PK1 cells released more LDH than MDCK cells in response to LPS (Fig 6), indicating that a mechanism downstream of TLR4 might be involved in LPS-induced tubular cell injury. Other studies have shown that TLR4 is the primary effector of LPS-mediated cellular responses, including the rapid release of cytokines []. This study shows that LPS enhances cytokine release in both of the tubular cell types studied (Fig 6). Among the cytokines released, IL-1β release was the most prominent (Fig 6). Moreover, TLR4 inhibition markedly attenuated IL-1β release with a 76% and 48% reduction in LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells, respectively. Though TLR4 was less abundant in LLC-PK1 than in MDCK cells, TLR4-mediated signaling (triggering IL-1β release) seemed to be more efficient in LLC-PK1 cells than in MDCK cells. Hence, LLC-PK1 cells appeared to be more sensitive to LPS treatment than MDCK cells. Interestingly, the results agree with previous findings that stimulation with toxic agents, such as oxalate, the environmental pollutant cadmium, and the nephrotoxic drug cyclosporine, results in stronger responses in LLC-PK1 cells than in MDCK cells [–].

26133372|t|IL-1 receptor inhibition completely abrogated LPS-induced cell injury, indicating that IL-1β is the main cytokine that triggers tubular cell death. We previously showed that a renoprotective strategy involving hypoxic preconditioning protects rat kidneys against the effects of LPS by attenuating IL-1β synthesis []. Interestingly, IL-1 receptor inhibition also attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of NR1 and S-Race, as well as D-serine synthesis and secretion (Fig 6), suggesting that IL-1β-mediated NMDA receptor hyperfunction could be the mechanism by which LPS induces tubular cell damage. This finding is corroborated by observations that signal pathways downstream of the IL-1 receptor and TLR4, including the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), induce LPS-mediated pleiotropic inflammatory responses []. NF-κB translocates to the nucleus during P19 cell differentiation into neurons and markedly increases NR1 promoter activity []. Another mechanism of relevance to NF-κB signaling is reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative stress, which we previously demonstrated in LPS-treated kidneys []. Oxidative stress, induced by exposure to superoxide, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide, upregulates NR1 expression in bEnd3 cells, an endothelial cell derived from primary murine brain microvasculature []. This, however, can be completely blocked by an inhibitor of NF-κB activation []. It is therefore likely that LPS-mediated reactive oxygen species formation and NF-κB activation will have profound effects on NR1 upregulation. Although the S-Race gene is not a target for NF-κB, S-Race expression in MG5 microglial cells is upregulated by LPS through c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAPK signaling []. Further work is required to determine whether MAPKs via LPS affect S-Race expression in tubular cells.

26133372|t|In conclusion, the results presented herein show that LPS-induced renal injury is dependent on the NMDA receptor. Upregulation of NR1 and S-Race, together with increases in D-serine content, cause NMDA receptor hyperfunction in tubular epithelium after LPS treatment. This, in turn, induces renal vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion in vivo and further contributes to tubular cell death in vitro. Finally, LPS-dependent IL-1β release plays a critical role in NR1 and S-Race upregulation in tubular cells.

26082470|t|Adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit mutations causing familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 3 (FHH3) demonstrate genotype–phenotype correlations, codon bias and dominant-negative effects
26082470|a|

26082470|t|The adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit (AP2σ2) is pivotal for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane constituents such as the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Mutations of the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue result in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 3 (FHH3), a disorder of extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) homeostasis. To elucidate the role of AP2σ2 in Ca2+o regulation, we investigated 65 FHH probands, without other FHH-associated mutations, for AP2σ2 mutations, characterized their functional consequences and investigated the genetic mechanisms leading to FHH3. AP2σ2 mutations were identified in 17 probands, comprising 5 Arg15Cys, 4 Arg15His and 8 Arg15Leu mutations. A genotype–phenotype correlation was observed with the Arg15Leu mutation leading to marked hypercalcaemia. FHH3 probands harboured additional phenotypes such as cognitive dysfunction. All three FHH3-causing AP2σ2 mutations impaired CaSR signal transduction in a dominant-negative manner. Mutational bias was observed at the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue as other predicted missense substitutions (Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser), which also caused CaSR loss-of-function, were not detected in FHH probands, and these mutations were found to reduce the numbers of CaSR-expressing cells. FHH3 probands had significantly greater serum calcium (sCa) and magnesium (sMg) concentrations with reduced urinary calcium to creatinine clearance ratios (CCCR) in comparison with FHH1 probands with CaSR mutations, and a calculated index of sCa × sMg/100 × CCCR, which was ≥ 5.0, had a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 86%, respectively, for FHH3. Thus, our studies demonstrate AP2σ2 mutations to result in a more severe FHH phenotype with genotype–phenotype correlations, and a dominant-negative mechanism of action with mutational bias at the Arg15 residue.

26082470|t|Introduction
26082470|a|

26082470|t|Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) homeostasis characterized by lifelong mild-to-moderate elevations of serum calcium concentrations, mild hypermagnesaemia, normal or elevated circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations and inappropriately low urinary calcium excretion [mean urinary calcium to creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) <0.01]. FHH is a genetically heterogeneous disorder comprising three reported variants. FHH types 1 and 2 (FHH1, OMIM #145980; FHH2, OMIM #145981) are due to heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and G-protein, Gα11, encoded by the CASR and GNA11 genes, respectively. CaSR and Gα11 are widely expressed, including in the parathyroid glands and kidneys, and play a pivotal role in Ca2+o homeostasis by detecting alterations in Ca2+o concentrations and initiating multiple intracellular signalling cascades that include phospholipase C-mediated accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and increases in intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) concentrations, which in turn lead to alterations in PTH secretion and urinary calcium excretion. FHH type 3 (FHH3, OMIM #600740) is associated with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of AP2S1, located on chromosome 19q13.3.

26082470|t|AP2S1 encodes the σ2-subunit of the ubiquitously expressed heterotetrameric adaptor protein-2 (AP2) complex, which also comprises α-, β2- and μ2-subunits. The AP2 complex is a central component of clathrin-coated vesicles and facilitates the endocytosis of plasma membrane constituents such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). AP2S1 mutations have been reported in 19 FHH patients and families to date, and these all comprise heterozygous missense substitutions of the AP2 σ2-subunit (AP2σ2) Arg15 residue (Arg15Cys, Arg15His and Arg15Leu). This Arg residue is located in a positively charged region of AP2σ2 that binds to specific peptide motifs on membrane cargo proteins. It is predicted that FHH3-causing Arg15 mutations disrupt binding of the AP2 complex to the intracellular carboxyl terminus of the CaSR, thereby impairing endocytosis of this GPCR. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro expression studies that have demonstrated AP2S1 mutations to affect CaSR cell-surface expression and signal transduction. These studies of AP2S1 mutations have highlighted a role for the AP2 endocytic complex in Ca2+o homeostasis. To date, 19 FHH3 patients have been reported with AP2σ2 mutations, comprising 8 Arg15Cys, 4 Arg15His and 7 Arg15Leu. To further elucidate the role and spectrum of AP2σ2 mutations in the aetiology of the phenotypic features of FHH3, we conducted studies to characterise the structural/functional consequences of AP2σ2 mutations together with their underlying genetic mechanisms in additional FHH patients, who did not have CASR or GNA11 mutations. Our study identified AP2σ2 mutations in 17 hypercalcaemic probands and their families, and further analysis of these AP2σ2 mutants has revealed the presence of a genotype–phenotype correlation, a mutational bias of the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue with a likely dominant-negative action and a clinical approach to differentiate patients with FHH3 from those with FHH1.

26082470|t|Clinical and biochemical findings in 17 FHH probands with AP2S1 mutations
26082470|a|

26082470|t|Detection of de novo AP2S1 mutations in families 02/03 and 06/13b. (A) DNA sequence analyses of the probands (arrowed) revealed a G-to-T transversion at codon 15, predicted to result in a missense amino acid substitution of Arg to Leu, and loss of a HhaI restriction endonuclease site. (B) Restriction map showing that HhaI digestion would result in two products of 143 and 252 bp from the wild-type (WT) sequence, but would not affect the mutant (m) sequence. PCR and HhaI digestion revealed the probands [individual II.4 of family 02/03 (C) and individual II.1 of family 06/13b (D)] to be heterozygous for the Arg15Leu mutation. The absence of the Arg15Leu mutation in the unaffected parents of both probands is consistent with the mutation arising de novo.

26082470|t|DNA sequence analysis of the entire AP2S1 429-bp coding region and 8 exon–intron boundaries was undertaken in 65 unrelated FHH probands without CASR or GNA11 mutations (22 males and 43 females). This revealed the presence of AP2S1 mutations in 17 probands (7 males and 10 females), thereby representing a >25% AP2S1 mutation detection rate in this cohort of FHH patients without CASR and GNA11 mutations. The FHH3-associated mutations only affected the AP2σ2 Arg15 (R15) residue and consisted of five Arg15Cys (R15C), four Arg15His (R15H) and eight Arg15Leu (R15L) mutations (Table 1), all of which had previously been reported to represent pathogenic mutations. Two unrelated FHH3 female probands, aged 7 and 15 years, harboured Arg15Leu mutations that were demonstrated to be absent in both of their parents, and hence likely to be arising de novo (Fig. 1). Four FHH3 subjects had symptoms attributable to hypercalcaemia, including lethargy, constipation, widespread musculoskeletal pain and polydipsia (Table 1). Eleven FHH3 probands had clinical features in addition to hypercalcaemia and hypocalciuria (Table 1). In particular, bone mineral density (BMD) was noted to be low (T-score < −1.0 or Z-score < −2.0) at the lumbar spine or femoral neck in 5 of 10 patients aged 14 to 64 years (Table 1). The low BMD in all five patients was not associated with renal dysfunction, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency or thyrotoxicosis. Furthermore, seven FHH3 patients (aged 3–37 years) were noted to have learning disabilities characterized by cognitive deficits and/or behavioural disturbances (Table 1). In addition, the father of a proband with learning disabilities (06/13a, Table 1) also had a cognitive deficit in association with hypercalcaemia. Two of the Arg15Leu probands with cognitive deficits (02/03 and 02/11, Table 1) had short stature with height at or below the third centile, and one of these probands (02/03, Table 1) was found to harbour an atrial septal defect, whereas the other individual (02/11, Table 1) suffered from recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. The pancreatitis in this patient was not due to gallstones or alcohol abuse, and analysis of genes known to be associated with pancreatitis, such as SPINK1, CFTR, PRSS1 and CTRC, did not reveal any mutations.

26082470|t|We examined for phenotypic differences between patients with Arg15Cys, Arg15His or Arg15Leu AP2S1 mutations. Analysis of biochemical and clinical data available for a total of 27 FHH3 probands [17 from this study and 10 from our previously reported study ] revealed that patients with the Arg15Leu mutation had significantly greater elevations of serum albumin adjusted-calcium concentrations when compared with those with the Arg15Cys and Arg15His AP2σ2 mutations (3.06 ± 0.04 mmol/l for Arg15Leu versus 2.83 ± 0.03 mmol/l for Arg15Cys and 2.74 ± 0.03 mmol/l for Arg15His, P < 0.01). Moreover, patients with the Arg15Cys mutation had a significantly greater hypercalcaemia (P < 0.05) than patients harbouring the Arg15His mutation. Such differences were not observed for other biochemical indices of mineral metabolism (Fig. 2).

26082470|t|To determine whether FHH3 is associated with any differences in the biochemical phenotype when compared with FHH1, we analysed the serum and urine biochemistry from 51 FHH3 subjects that included affected members of the previously reported multi-generational FHH3 kindreds from Oklahoma (FHHOK) and Northern Ireland (FHHNI), and 43 previously reported FHH1 probands, who all harboured CASR mutations. This revealed FHH3 patients to have a greater degree of hypercalcaemia than the FHH1 patients (serum adjusted-calcium = 2.87 ± 0.02 mmol/l for FHH3 versus 2.76 ± 0.02 mmol/l for FHH1, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). FHH3 patients when compared with FHH1 patients also had significantly marked hypermagnesaemia (serum magnesium = 1.04 ± 0.02 mmol/l for FHH3 versus 0.95 ± 0.02 mmol/l for FHH1, P < 0.01) and hypocalciuria (CCCR = 0.004 ± 0.001 for FHH3 versus 0.007 ± 0.001 for FHH1, P < 0.01) (Fig. 3). There were no significant differences in the serum concentrations of phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity or PTH between the FHH3 and FHH1 patients (Fig. 3). As serum adjusted-calcium, serum magnesium and CCCR values were significantly different between FHH3 and FHH1 patients, we investigated whether the combined use of these biochemical parameters could be utilized to discriminate between these two hypercalcaemic disorders. Based on the observation that serum adjusted-calcium (sCa) and serum magnesium (sMg) values are elevated, whereas CCCR is reduced in FHH3, a calculated index (sCa × sMg/100 × CCCR), designated CMCR, was determined for each of the subjects in the FHH1 and FHH3 groups (Fig. 3) with all biochemical parameters being measured in millimole per litre. Receiver–operator curve (ROC) analysis of the CMCR index (Fig. 3) revealed an area-under-the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (P < 0.001) and an optimal cut-off value of 5.0 for discriminating between FHH3 and FHH1, which provides a diagnostic sensitivity of 83% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 61–95] and specificity of 86% (95% CI = 57–98), and positive and negative predictive values of 90% (95% CI = 70–98) and 80% (95% CI = 52–95), respectively.

26082470|a|

26082470|t|Observed and predicted mutations at the AP2S1 Arg15 (R15) residue. (A) Schematic representation of possible nucleotide and amino acid substitutions affecting codon 15. Substitutions affecting the first or second nucleotide of codon 15 (CGC) are predicted to lead to one of six possible non-synonymous mutations or variants, which are Cys15 (TGC), Gly15 (GGC), His15 (CAC), Leu15 (CTC), Pro15 (CCC) or Ser15 (AGC). Substitutions affecting the third nucleotide of the CGC triplet are predicted to lead to synonymous variants only. (B) Crystal structure of the α-subunit (green) and σ2-subunit (blue) of the AP2 heterotetrameric complex bound to an acidic (Gln-containing) dileucine cargo protein motif [PDB file 2JKR ]. The key polar contacts (black dashed lines) between the σ2-subunit Arg15 residue (σArg15, red) and α-subunit Arg21 residue (αArg21, grey), and a Gln residue located four residues from the first Leu residue of the acidic dileucine motif [Gln(Leu-4), orange], are shown. (C–G) Structural analysis of six potential Arg15 mutations demonstrating that the observed mutants (Cys15, His15 and Leu15) and non-observed mutants (Gly15, Pro15 and Ser15) are all predicted to result in the loss of the key polar contact with the cargo protein Gln (Leu-4) residue.

26082470|t|The present study has identified 17 hypercalcaemic patients with AP2S1 mutations that all affected the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue, and previous studies have reported 19 AP2S1 mutations that all affect the Arg15 residue yielding a total of 36 FHH3-causing mutations identified to date. These 36 AP2S1 mutations involving substitutions of Arg15 comprise 13 Arg15Cys, 8 Arg15His and 15 Arg15Leu. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the Arg15 codon reveals it to be CGC indicating that missense substitutions affecting the first or second nucleotides would be predicted to be non-synonymous and lead to one of six possible amino acid substitutions, which comprise Cys, Gly, His, Leu, Pro and Ser (Fig. 4). This expected observation of six different amino acid substitutions contrasts significantly (P < 0.0001, Chi-squared test) with the three Arg15-mutant substitutions observed in FHH3 patients.

26082470|t|To investigate the potential occurrence of the Arg15Cys, Arg15His and Arg15Leu, and the absence of Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser variants, we assessed the effects of all six potential Arg15 mutants on the structure and function of AP2. Analysis of the AP2 complex crystal structure predicted that all the six Arg15 missense substitutions, including the Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser variants that have not been observed in FHH3, would impair AP2 complex function by disrupting a key polar contact between the AP2 complex and the cargo protein dileucine recognition motif (Fig. 4). Thus, all the six Arg15 missense substitutions would significantly alter the structure, and we therefore determined their functional consequences on CaSR activity, by expressing them in HEK293 cells that stably expressed the CaSR (HEK-CaSR). Transient transfection of the wild-type or mutant AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP expression constructs, or vector containing the red fluorescence protein (RFP) reporter gene alone, was undertaken in the HEK-CaSR cells. Expression of the CaSR and RFP, which represents a surrogate of AP2σ2 expression, was detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting of whole-cell lysates (Fig. 5), and the responses of Ca2+i concentrations to alterations in Ca2+o concentrations were then assayed by flow cytometry.

26082470	47	50	Arg	Chemical	MESH:D001120

26082470|t|HEK-CaSR cells expressing each of the six Arg15 missense AP2σ2 variants (i.e. the three observed Arg15Cys, Arg15His and Arg15Leu and the three non-observed Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser AP2σ2 variants) were found to have half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values that were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than cells expressing the wild-type AP2σ2 protein. Thus, the three non-observed Arg15 AP2σ2 variants decreased the sensitivity of HEK-CaSR cells to Ca2+o concentrations in a similar manner to the three FHH3-causing AP2σ2 mutations (Fig. 5 and Table 2). However, cells expressing the non-observed Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro or Arg15Ser AP2σ2 mutants were found to have significantly reduced increases in cell numbers over a 24-h period, when compared with cells expressing wild-type or FHH3-mutant AP2σ2 proteins (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser AP2σ2 mutants are likely not observed as they are associated with an impairment of cell growth, when compared with wild-type or the FHH3-associated mutant AP2σ2 proteins (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Material, Fig. S1).

26082470|t|Dominant-negative effects of AP2S1 mutations
26082470|a|

26082470|t|Comparison of EC50 values for HEK-CaSR cells transfected with increasing amounts of wild-type (WT) or mutant AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP expression constructs. (A) During flow cytometry, fluorescence over a 1–10 000 range can be detected. The first large peak represents cells not expressing RFP but displaying low levels of auto-fluorescence. Cells displaying increased fluorescence with respect to this population reflect those expressing RFP. Cells from five different RFP fluorescences were selected on the basis of mean fluorescence (gate 1 log mean fluorescence = 50–100, gate 2 log mean fluorescence = 125–250, gate 3 log mean fluorescence = 500–1000, gate 4 log mean fluorescence = 1250–2500 and gate 5 log mean fluorescence = 5000–10000), consistent with a fluorescence ranging from between 1- and 100-fold over baseline, i.e. between gate 1 and gate 5, which represent the lowest and the highest levels of RFP fluorescence, and therefore AP2σ2, respectively. (B) Predicted linear regressions of mean EC50 with effects owing to dominant-negative and haploinsufficiency mutants. Loss-of-function mutants with dominant-negative effects on the WT protein will exert greater effects on EC50 values with increasing concentrations (red line), whereas loss-of-function mutants associated with haploinsufficiency of the WT protein will not affect the EC50 values with increasing concentrations as the EC50 will depend on the concentration of WT protein, which will remain constant (blue line). (C–E) Linear regression of the mean EC50 of cells with increasing levels of AP2σ2 expression demonstrate no significant deviation from zero in cells transfected with the WT-R15 AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP expression construct (r2 = 0.07, P = 0.67), whereas a significantly positive incline to the slope is observed in cells transfected with the mutant AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP expression constructs (C15 r2 = 0.82, P < 0.05; H15 r2 = 0.84, P < 0.05; L15 r2 = 0.99, P < 0.0001), thereby indicating that FHH3-associated AP2σ2 mutations may act in a dominant-negative manner. All experiments were conducted on N = 8 separate occasions.
26082470|a|

26082470|t|FHH3 is associated with heterozygous loss-of-function AP2σ2 mutations, and these could be causing the disease by either haploinsufficiency (i.e. a reduced dosage of the wild-type AP2σ2 protein) or dominant-negative effects on the heterotetrameric AP2 complex. To investigate these genetic mechanisms, we studied the effects of altering the dosage of wild-type and mutant AP2σ2 proteins on the EC50 responses of HEK-CaSR cells that were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP expression constructs. We used the bidirectional AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP vector as it expresses RFP and AP2σ2 at equivalent levels, thereby enabling RFP expression to be used as a surrogate for AP2σ2 expression. We selected populations of cells with increasing levels of RFP expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 6) and assessed the effects of altering wild-type and mutant AP2σ2 dosage by measuring the Ca2+i responses of the HEK-CaSR cells to changes in Ca2+o concentrations, and determining the linear regression of mean EC50 values against expression levels of wild-type and mutant AP2σ2 proteins. In this experiment, loss-of-function mutations with dominant-negative actions, which would exert greater effects with increasing protein concentrations, will show a positive correlation between mutant protein concentration and EC50. However, loss-of-function mutations associated with haploinsufficiency would not exert effects on the wild-type protein, whose concentration would remain constant, and hence there would be absent correlation between mutant protein concentrations and EC50 values (Fig. 6).

26082470|t|The results of such linear regression analyses revealed that increased expression levels of FHH3-causing Arg15-mutant AP2σ2 proteins progressively impaired the sensitivity of HEK-CaSR cells, as highlighted by a significantly positive relationship between the expression levels of all three AP2σ2 mutants and the mean cellular EC50 responses (Cys15 r2 = 0.82, P < 0.05; His15 r2 = 0.84, P < 0.05; Leu15 r2 = 0.99, P < 0.0001), but that increased expression levels of wild-type AP2σ2 had no effect on EC50 values (r2 = 0.07, P = 0.67) (Fig. 6). These findings indicate a potential dominant-negative effect of the FHH3-causing Arg15 AP2σ2 mutants.

26082470|a|

26082470|t|Our results, which have identified AP2S1 mutations that only result in missense substitutions of the Arg15 residue in 17 additional FHH probands, have helped to establish a genotype–phenotype correlation between AP2σ2 mutants and the severity of hypercalcaemia; devise an index based on measurements of plasma calcium and magnesium concentrations and urinary clearances of calcium and creatinine to differentiate between FHH1 and FHH3; elucidate the occurrence of a mutational bias at the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue in FHH3 patients and define the likely genetic mechanism for AP2σ2 mutations as being a dominant-negative action in causing FHH3. In addition, our study shows that FHH3 can be associated with de novo AP2S1 mutations, consistent with a previous report, thereby indicating that patients may not have a family history of the disorder and that AP2S1 mutations may be associated with non-familial forms of hypercalcaemia and hypocalciuria.

26082470|t|The identification by this study of AP2S1 mutations in 17 additional probands with FHH3, together with ours and other previous reports, yields a total of 36 probands with such AP2σ2 mutations, which all involve the Arg15 residue and result in 1 of 3 missense substitutions comprising Arg15Cys, Arg15His and Arg15Leu. Our analyses of these subjects reveal genotype–phenotype correlations for these AP2σ2 mutations, in which the Arg15Leu mutation is associated with the most pronounced hypercalcaemia, whereas Arg15His is associated with the mildest increase in serum calcium concentrations. This is surprising and the mechanisms underlying these genotype–phenotype correlations are unclear, as three-dimensional modelling and in vitro functional expression studies indicate that all three Arg15 AP2σ2 mutations disrupt CaSR activity to a similar extent, and the basis for the differences between our in vivo clinical observations and in vitro results remains to be elucidated.

26082470|t|Our study has also revealed phenotypic differences between FHH1 and FHH3. In particular, FHH3 was associated with significantly greater elevations of serum calcium, and >20% of FHH3 patients in this cohort had symptomatic hypercalcaemia. These findings are not typical of FHH, which is considered to be a benign and asymptomatic disorder, and in general associated with serum calcium concentrations that remain within 10% of the upper limit of the normal range. In addition to the more severe hypercalcaemia, FHH3 was associated with more pronounced suppression of urinary calcium excretion than FHH1. The more marked serum and urinary calcium phenotype of FHH3 contrasts with the results of in vitro studies that indicate FHH3-causing AP2S1 mutations to lead to a milder shift in the set point of CaSR-expressing cells when compared with FHH1-causing CASR mutations. These findings suggest that AP2σ2 mutations may influence Ca2+o homeostasis through effects on cell membrane proteins other than the CaSR. Indeed, the renal thick ascending limb Na+/K+/2Cl− (NKCC2) transporter, which is pivotal for urinary calcium reabsorption, has been demonstrated to be regulated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Other phenotypic differences between FHH3 and FHH1 included the occurrence of low BMD and cognitive dysfunction in FHH3. Low BMD occurred in five FHH3 probands with AP2S1 mutations whereas patients with FHH1, owing to CASR mutations, have been reported to have normal bone resorption rates and BMD measurements at the spine, hip and forearm. Cognitive dysfunction was observed in seven FHH3 probands, four of which presented with serum calcium concentrations of >3.0 mmol/l, and exposure to marked hypercalcaemia in infancy or childhood may have led to developmental delay and adversely affected neurological development in these individuals. It is also possible that expression of mutant AP2σ2 subunits within the brain may directly influence neurological development, consistent with the role of the AP2 complex in mediating receptor trafficking within neuronal synapses of the hippocampus, a region of the brain required for memory acquisition and spatial orientation. The Arg15Leu AP2S1 mutation was also associated with recurrent pancreatitis in one FHH3 proband, a finding consistent with FHH1, in which recurrent pancreatitis has occasionally been reported. However, FHH1 probands with pancreatitis typically harbour heterozygous mutations of both the CASR and serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) genes. In contrast, the affected FHH3 proband did not harbour a mutation of SPINK1 or other genes associated with pancreatitis, and this proband's marked hypercalcaemia may have been sufficient to disrupt pancreatic function. Given these possible phenotypic differences between FHH3 and FHH1, we sought to design an index based on clinical biochemistry tests of serum and urine that would help to differentiate the two disorders. The findings that FHH3 is associated with greater elevations in serum calcium and magnesium concentrations, and reductions in urinary calcium excretion, when compared with FHH1, led us to design the calcium–magnesium–calcium clearance ratio (CMCR), calculated as sCa × sMg/100 × CCCR. Assessment of the performance characteristics of this index indicated that FHH patients with CMCR ≥5.0 were significantly more likely to have FHH3. Thus, the CMCR index may have utility in the clinical setting for directing FHH patients for either CASR or AP2S1 gene analysis, with patients having a CMCR value of ≥5.0 being prioritized for AP2S1 analysis (Fig. 7). However, ∼30% of FHH3 patients have CMCR values that overlap with that of FHH1 patients (Fig. 3), and combined analysis of the CASR, AP2S1 and GNA11 genes is suggested in individuals with CMCR values of <5.0 (Fig. 7). No correlation was observed between the CMCR index and codon 15 genotype of the FHH3 patients. The CMCR index requires further validation in studies of other populations and using alternate biochemical assays.

26082470|t|The finding that all the 36 reported FHH3 patients, of which 17 are from this study, harbour either an Arg15Cys, Arg15His or Arg15Leu mutation, highlights the importance of this evolutionary conserved residue for AP2-mediated Ca2+o homeostasis. Furthermore, the absence of the other possible missense substitutions at this codon (Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro or Arg15Ser) indicates mutation bias at the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue. Our in vitro characterization of the non-observed Gly15, Pro15 or Ser15 mutations demonstrated these mutant AP2σ2 proteins to be expressed and to result in an impairment of CaSR activity. However, the Gly15, Pro15 or Ser15 mutants had additional deleterious effects that led to a reduction in the numbers of cells expressing these mutants. These findings indicate a potential role for the AP2 complex in cell growth or viability and are consistent with a previously reported study of mice harbouring a germline ablation of the AP2μ2 subunit, which led to early embryonic lethality, thus highlighting the involvement of the ubiquitously expressed AP2 complex in mammalian development. Thus, a possible explanation for the absence of the Arg15Gly, Arg15Pro and Arg15Ser AP2σ2 mutations in patients is that these deleterious mutations likely result in embryonic lethality, whereas the FHH3-causing AP2σ2 mutations Arg15Cys, Arg15His and Arg15Leu are observed in patients, as these mutations are not associated with deleterious effects on cell growth, but are tolerated and compatible with embryonic and post-natal survival.

26082470|t|Our findings of a likely dominant-negative effect of FHH3-causing Arg15 AP2σ2 mutations are consistent with previous mutagenesis studies of the AP2 complex. Indeed, overexpression of a mutated μ2-subunit (AP2μ2), which displayed diminished capacity to bind to some cargo proteins, has been reported to inhibit receptor trafficking in a dominant-negative manner. The precise mechanisms of such dominant-negative actions remain to be established but three possibilities are (1) the incorporation of a mutant σ2 subunit may impair the assembly of the tetrameric complex, (2) incorporation of the mutant σ2 subunit may alter the structure of the AP2 complex and hinder the efficiency of wild-type AP2α, AP2β and AP2μ subunits and (3) the mutant AP2 complex may potentially sequester the CaSR at the plasma membrane and prevent wild-type AP2 molecules from effectively trafficking this GPCR.

26082470|t|In summary, our studies of AP2S1 mutations, which highlight FHH3 as a distinct disorder of Ca2+o homeostasis and demonstrate the importance of the AP2σ2 Arg15 residue for AP2 function, have revealed genotype–phenotype correlations with mutation bias at the Arg15 residue, as well as a likely dominant-negative mechanism of action.

Sixty-five unrelated probands (22 males and 43 females) were ascertained. The age at diagnosis or presentation ranged from early infancy to 76 years, and all probands had hypercalcaemia with normal or elevated PTH concentrations, in association with inappropriately low urinary calcium excretion. Previous mutational analysis of CASR and GNA11 had not identified any abnormalities of the coding regions and exon–intron boundaries of these genes.

The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger) was used to model the effect of the FHH3-associated AP2σ2 mutations on the interaction with the acidic dileucine motif peptide using the three-dimensional structure of AP2 archived in the Protein Data Bank at the European Bioinformatics Institute with the accession number 2JKR. The effect of the Arg15Cys, Arg15Leu, Arg15His, Arg15Pro, Arg15Ser and Arg15Gly mutations on the interaction of AP2σ2 subunit with the acidic dileucine peptide was modelled using PyMod plug-in and Modeller.21.

26082470|t|Generation of AP2S1 expression constructs
26082470|a|

26082470|t|An AP2σ2 expression construct was generated by cloning the full-length AP2S1 coding region into the bidirectional cloning vector pBI-CMV4-RFP (Clontech), which allows for co-expression of AP2σ2 and RFP at equivalent levels. The use of RFP minimized overlap between the emission spectra of this reporter gene and the indo-1-AM Ca2+-binding fluorophore. AP2S1 mutations were introduced into the construct by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Lightning, Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, as described.

26082470|t|Cell culture and transfection
26082470|a|

26082470|t|Functional studies of AP2S1 mutations were performed in HEK293 cells that stably expressed the CaSR. HEK293 cells were used because suitable parathyroid and renal tubular cells are not available, and HEK293 cells have been established as a model for such studies. The reported stably CaSR-transfected HEK293 cell line (HEK-CaSR) was cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% geneticin. A high level of CaSR expression in these cells was confirmed by western blot analysis of whole-cell protein extract using a mouse monoclonal antibody to human CaSR (ADD; Abcam, ab19347, 1:1000). The wild-type and mutant AP2σ2 constructs were transiently transfected into HEK-CaSR cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Expression of RFP was used as a surrogate for AP2σ2 expression as it is expressed at equivalent levels to AP2σ2 by the pBI-CMV4-RFP bidirectional vector. Western blot analysis of cellular protein extract was undertaken using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to RFP (Thermo Scientific, PA1-986, 1:500). The membrane was re-probed with mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam, ab8245, 1:3000) as a loading control. Successful transfection was also confirmed by visualising RFP fluorescence using an Eclipse E400 fluorescence microscope with an epifluorescence filter, and images were captured using a DXM1200C digital camera and NIS Elements software (Nikon). The effect of mutant AP2σ2 proteins on cell growth was assessed by determining the percentage increase in cell numbers over a 24-h period, as follows. Twenty-four hours after transfection, equal numbers of cells were seeded into a 96-well plate, and the cells were imaged, at 48 and 72 h, using fluorescence microscopy, as mentioned above. Following blinding to both transfection and time point, the numbers of transfected cells were counted manually at 48 and 72 h post-transfection, and the percentage increase in cells determined using Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis undertaken in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad).

26082470|t|The effect of mutant AP2σ2 proteins on CaSR-mediated Ca2+i responses were assessed by determining EC50 values (i.e. [Ca2+]o required for 50% of the maximal response) and comparing these to the wild-type EC50, as reported. Briefly, 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed in calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen) and loaded with 1 μg/ml indo-1-acetoxymethylester (Indo-1-am) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C. After the removal of free dye, the cells were resuspended in calcium- and magnesium-free HBSS and maintained at 37°C. Flow cytometry was performed with a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP equipped with JDSUY Xcyte UV Laser and a Coherent Sapphire 488 Laser using a 550LP dichroic mirror and 580/30 bandpass filter. Single cells were isolated from debris on the basis of morphology using forward scatter and side scatter readings. Cells were stimulated by sequentially adding calcium to the calcium- and magnesium-free HBSS to progressively increase the [Ca2+]o from 0 to 15 mm. The baseline fluorescence ratio was measured for 2 min, the fluorescence ratio compared with the time was recorded and data were collected for 2 min at each [Ca2+]o. Cytomation Summit software was used to determine the peak mean fluorescence ratio of the transient response after each individual stimulus expressed as a normalized response. Analysis of five separate populations of cells gated for increasing RFP as a concordant surrogate for increasing AP2σ2 expression was undertaken and concentration–response curves generated using the normalized response at each of nine different [Ca2+]o (0–15 mm) for each separate experiment. Nonlinear regression of the concentration–response curves was performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad) to calculate the EC50 for each separate experiment. Subsequent linear regression of the mean EC50 (N = 8 experiments) for each AP2S1-pBI-CMV4-RFP expression vector was undertaken with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad).

26082470|a|

26082470|t|The phenotypic data from this study were pooled with those of our previous studies of FHH3 patients and families. To undertake a comparison of phenotypes between FHH3 and FHH1, we used data from 43 previously reported unrelated FHH1 probands (13 males and 30 females, aged 1–84 years) who had germline heterozygous CASR mutations. Comparisons of continuous variables between two groups were undertaken using the Mann–Whitney U test, and the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare multiple groups. Categorical variables were analysed using the Chi-squared test. ROC analysis using values of the CMCR sensitivity and specificity was performed to study the discriminatory power of the CMCR index to distinguish between FHH1 and FHH3. Comparisons of EC50 values were performed using the F test, as described. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the proliferation rates of cells expressing wild-type or mutant AP2σ2 proteins. All analyses were undertaken using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad) and are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.

26277606|t|The Effectiveness of Pemetrexed Monotherapy Depending on Polymorphisms in TS and MTHFR Genes as Well as Clinical Factors in Advanced NSCLC Patients
26277606|a|
26277606	21	31	Pemetrexed	Chemical	MESH:D000068437

26277606|t|In NSCLC, second-line chemotherapy using pemetrexed or docetaxel has limited efficacy and should be dedicated to selected groups of patients. Pemetrexed is an antifolate compound with the ability to inhibit enzymes (TS, DHFR and GARFT) involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between polymorphisms of TS and MHFR genes and clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 72 non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed. Using PCR and RFLP methods, the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), the G > C SNP in these repeats and insertion/deletion polymorphism of TS gene as well as 677C > T SNP in MTHFR gene were analyzed and correlated with disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients. Carriers of 2R/3R(G), 3R(C)/3R(G), 3R(G)/3R(G) genotypes showed significantly more frequent early progression than carriers of 2R/2R, 2R/3R(C), 3R(C)/3R(C) genotypes of TS gene (p < 0.05). Among carriers of triple 28 bp tandem repeats (3R) in TS gene and C/C genotype of MTHFR gene a significantly shorter OS was observed (HR = 3.07; p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, significantly higher risk of death was observed in carriers of both 3R/3R genotype in TS and C/C genotype in 677C > T SNP in MTHFR (HR = 3.85; p < 0.005) as well as in patients with short duration of response to first-line chemotherapy (HR = 2.09; p < 0.005). Results of our study suggested that genetic factors may have a high predictive and prognostic value (even greater than clinical factors) for patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy.

26277606|t|Introduction
26277606|a|

26277606|t|Lung cancer is the most prevalent cause of death due to malignancies worldwide. There is very low percentage of early diagnosed NSCLC patients which results in only 15 % chance of surgical resection [1]. Systemic therapy (chemo- and radiotherapy) is considered to be the main form of lung cancer treatment. Unfortunately, first-line treatment is of low effectiveness and progression is observed in the vast majority of patients.
26277606|a|

26277606|t|Pemetrexed is one of the novel 3rd generation drugs with the least side effects reported. In the first-line study, cisplatin with pemetrexed proved to be more effective in non-squamous histology of NSCLC and as a result it was registered in only such histology of lung cancer [2]. Second-line treatment with pemetrexed monotherapy is possible in non-squamous patients with good performance status who progressed after non-pemetrexed first-line chemotherapy, which was proven by a comparative study with docetaxel [3].

26277606|t|Pemetrexed, a multitarget antifolate, is effective in non-squamous NSCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma, with the main focus on inhibition of enzymes involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis such as thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). TS catalyzes transformation of dUMP into dTMP. Decreased levels of dTMP results in inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis, thus cell death [2–4].

26277606|t|Studies have shown that expression levels of pemetrexed target enzymes may alter the effectiveness of the drug [5, 6, 7]. Squamous cell carcinoma was shown to have higher expression of TS than adenocarcinoma, thus being more resistant to pemetrexed treatment [8, 9].

26277606|t|Free circulating folates may regulate pemetrexed targets’ activity. Increased level of methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF) is a result of changes in the activity of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which results in higher TS activity and thus reduces pemetrexed efficacy [10].

26277606|t|There are three well known polymorphic changes that affect TS mRNA level and TS protein expression: various number of 28-base pair tandem repeats (VNTR) located in the 5′ end untranslated region of TS gene; a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G > C in the second repeat of the 28-bp tandem repeats; and a 6-bp deletion at the 3’ end of the TS gene (1494del6) [11–13]. Polymorphisms in TS gene are known to alter effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer [14]. Moreover, MTHFR gene polymorphism 677C > T is causing lower expression of MTHFR and decreased levels of 5-methylTHF in colon and breast cancer cell lines [15].

26277606|t|The whole studied group consisted of 72 NSCLC patients (46 male, 26 female; median age 61) with non-squamous histology, who were treated with pemetrexed monotherapy. Clinical data was collected from all patients. 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed was administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 21 day cycle. In order to reduce toxicity, patients received folic acid and B12 vitamin prior to treatment.

26277606|t|Genotyping of TS and MTHFR
26277606|a|

26277606|t|All studied polymorphism were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers used in TS gene VNTR polymorphism analysis were previously described by Iacopetta et al. [16]. The analysis of G > C SNP in tandem repeats of TS gene was carried out using allele-specific PCR (ASP-PCR) with forward primers designed specifically for G or C nucleotide (5’CGTCCCGCCGCGCCACTTG 3’ and 5’CGTCCCGCCGCGCCACTTC 3’, respectively). The reverse primer was the same one used in the VNTR analysis, described by Iacopetta et al. The ASP-PCR was carried out in two separate PCR tubes, one for G-ending primer and one for C-ending primer. The 1494del6 deletion on the 3’ end of TS gene and MTHFR 677C > T SNP were detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique. Primers used for the detection of 1494del6 were previously described by Dotor et al. [17], while the MTHFR 677C > T SNP primers were previously described by Frosst et al. [18]. For the RFLP reaction Fermentas FastDigest DraI (Thermo Scientific, USA) for TS 1494del6 polymorphism and Fermentas FastDigest HinfI (Thermo Scientific, USA) for MTHFR 677C > T SNP restriction enzymes were used. The digestion process was carried out under the following conditions: 10 min. incubtion in 37° followed by 5 min. digestion in 65°.

26277606|t|Every polymorphism analysis was carried out in the same reaction mixture of 20 μl, with only PCR primers being changed specifically for the polymorphism. The mixture contained: 100 ng of sample DNA, 1 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM of MgCl2 and 1 U Taq polymerase with 1 × Reaction Buffer (Thermo Scientific, USA). All reactions were carried out in a Biometra TPersonal thermocycler (Biometra, Germany).

26277606|t|Products of PCR were visualised on 2 % agarose gel with ethidium bromide. TS VNTR polymorphism PCR products differed according to the number of 28 bp repeats. In Caucasian population the most often described genotypes consist of two or three repeats: 2R/2R and 3R/3R homozygotes, and 2R/3R heterozygotes. 2R/2R homozygotes produce a 116 bp band on the gel, 3R/3R homozygotes produce a 144 bp band, and heterozygotes show both bands - 116 and 144 bp. The ASP-PCR for the G > C SNP in TS gene shows two band patterns: the common G nucleotide presented three bands: 124 and 96 bp specific for G-ending primer and 68 bp band specific for C-ending primer, the rare C nucleotide presented three bands of 124 bp for G-ending primer and two bands of 96 and 68 bp for C-ending primer. The reaction products of G > C SNP are shown in two separate lanes, one for G-ending primer and one for C-ending primer.

26277606|t|The 6 bp deletion at the 3’ end of TS gene shows two band types: 142 bp for −6/−6 genotype and 148 bp for +6/+6 bp. The PCR products digestion with DraI restriction enzyme is possible only when the insertion genotype is present, so it creates two smaller bands of 88 and 60 bp. The heterozygous genotype +6/−6 presents four bands of 148, 142, 88 and 60 bp. The products of PCR for 677C > T SNP in MTHFR gene present following patterns: 198 bp band for C/C genotype and 175 and 23 bp band for T/T genotype when digested with HinfI restriction enzyme. The C/T heterozygote is present on the gel as three band of 198, 175 and 23 bp. The smallest band of 23 bp is not visible on the gel as it is migrating on the gel with reaction primers.

26277606|t|Statistical Analysis
26277606|a|

26277606|t|Yates’ chi-square test was used to assess differences between categorical variables and deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Groups of patients with different clinical and molecular factors were compared using Kaplan-Meier method, in order to determine the probability of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). To determine the influence of the studied factors on PFS and OS of patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy, the Cox regression model with step-by-step selection was used.

26277606|a|

26277606|t|The studied group consisted of NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy in second- or third-line and first-line patients who were not eligible for cisplatin. In this group there were 24 carriers of double 28 bp tandem repeats (33.3 %), 17 triple repeats (23.6 %), the rest (43.1 %) were heterozygous. Among the carriers of triple repeats in one or both alleles, the G nucleotide in the second repeat of 28 bp appeared in 25 patients (34.7 %). The presence of 1494del6 deletion was observed in 8 patients (11.1 %), there were 28 carriers of one allele with deletion (38.95 %) and the insertion was present in 50 % of patients. Allele T in 677C > T SNP in MTHFR gene was present in 40 patients (55.6 %) among which there were 11 T/T homozygous patients (15.3 % of the whole studied group).

In 24 patients (33.3 %) disease progression was observed during first two months after pemetrexed monotherapy. Median progression-free survival reached 4.5 months, while median overall survival reached 9 months.

26277606|t|It was observed that among carriers of triple 28 bp tandem repeats with G allele in the second tandem repeat, disease progression was significantly more frequent (p = 0.0287) than among carriers of other genotype combinations. PFS and OS were shorter in carriers of such genotype, however these were not statistically significant differences (Table 2). Only among carriers of both triple tandem repeats in TS gene and C/C genotype in MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism, a double shortening of PFS may be observed in comparison to carriers of other genotype combinations. However, this difference was not statistically significant either (Fig. 1, Table 2).

26277606|t|Discussion
26277606|a|

26277606|t|In second-line therapy, pemetrexed is administered as monotherapy, and this form was registered based on a large-scale, multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical trial performed on 571 NSCLC patients. The study compared the effectiveness of second-line pemetrexed or docetaxel monotherapy and it did not show differences in efficacy of the drugs, however significantly less toxicity was observed after pemetrexed treatment. In pemetrexed arm objective response and stable disease was observed in 71.2 % of the studied group, PFS reached 2.9 months and OS – 8.3 months. The study also revealed that the basic clinical factors such as good performance status (PS = 0), locally advanced disease and time since last chemotherapy over 3 months are positively influencing overall survival in NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy [3].

26277606|t|Pemetrexed monotherapy was compared with a pemetrexed/carboplatin regime, in second-line of NSCLC treatment, in GOIRC 02–2006 clinical trial. PFS in the pemetrexed arm reached 3.6 months and OS – 8.8 months, which were similar to the result of the Hanna et al. trial. Two-drug regime showed slightly higher effectiveness but for a price of higher toxicity [19].

26277606|t|Maintenance therapy using pemetrexed is possible in selected non-squamous NSCLC patients. The PARAMOUNT clinical trial showed that pemetrexed monotherapy after successful first-line pemetrexed/platinum therapy, extends progression-free survival to 4.1 months and overall survival to 13.9 months [20].

26277606|t|In our study, we reached results similar to the ones obtained by Hanna et al. Median PFS in patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy was 4.5 months and OS – 9 months. Such results were reached even though only 18 % of our studied group received further treatment lines. Only slight but not significant differences in OS are visible between patients with different PS (12.5 vs. 10.5 months for PS = 0 and PS = 1, respectively), in patients with or without anemia (9.5 vs. 12.5 months) and in patients with long and short response to first-line non-pemetrexed chemotherapy (12 vs.7 months).

26277606|t|Clinical factors are important in proper qualification to chemotherapy but it is not always possible to choose the best option based only on them, thus molecular factors are being studied more and more intensively in order to find relevant ones, also in pemetrexed treatment.

26277606|t|The most often studied molecular factor is the expression of thymidylate synthase. A study on 110 NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed in third- or fourth-line did not show any significant influence of TS expression on PFS or OS. However it is worth mentioning that the researchers had only limited access to cancer tissue (only 13 out of 55 samples were eligible for immunohistochemical analysis) [21].

26277606|t|Analysis of pemetrexed target genes (TS, DHFR, GARFT and MTHFR) was carried out on 90 adenocarcinoma Asian patients treated with pemetrexed monotherapy in third- or further lines. No relationship was found between the polymorphisms and response rates, but it is interesting that carriers of “high expression” genotypes in TS gene (2R/3R(G), 3R(C)/3R(G), 3R(G)/3R(G)) reached longer PFS (5.2 vs. 3.7 months) and OS (31.8 vs. 18.5 months) than carriers of “low expression” genotypes (2R/2R, 2R/3R(C), 3R(C)/3R(C)), which is in contradiction to the results from the studies of the same polymorphism but in first-line pemetrexed treatment [22].

26277606|t|Smit et al. carried out a comparison of pemetrexed monotherapy with pemetrexed/carboplatin regime in second-line treatment of NSCLC patients. As a part of the study a pharmacogenetic analysis was carried out. There was no connection between “low/high expression” genotypes of TS gene and treatment results, but a significant correlation was observed in carriers of T/T genotype of MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism, where PFS was longer for such patients when compared to carriers of other genotypes (7.9 vs. 2.9 months; p = 0.003) [23].

26277606|t|The analysis of two clinical trials: GOIRC 02–2006 (19) and NVALT-7 (23), for polymorphisms connected with pemetrexed effectiveness, showed that T/T genotype of MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism is correlated with longer PFS (5.4 vs. 3.4 months; p = 0.012) and OS (16.4 vs. 8.5 months; p = 0.026) when compared to other genotypes (C/C and C/T) [24].

26277606|t|In our study carriers of “high expression” genotypes in TS gene showed significantly more frequent early progression than carriers of “low expression” genotypes. Small (but not statistically significant) differences in OS were observed among carriers of different genotypes of MTHFR gene 677C > T polymorphism (17.5 vs. 11 months for carriers of T/T and C/C + C/T, respectively). Among carriers of 3R/3R genotype in TS gene and C/C genotype of MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism a significantly shorter OS was observed (6.75 vs. 12 months for carriers of 3R/3R + C/C and carriers of other genotype combinations respectively; p = 0.0031). Moreover, in multivariate analysis, significantly higher risk of death was observed in carriers of both 3R/3R genotype in TS gene and C/C genotype in 677C > T SNP in MTHFR gene as well as in patients with short PFS after first-line non-pemetrexed chemotherapy. These results are in line with other studies, where the presence of 3R/3R genotype in TS gene and C/C genotype in MTHFR gene where considered negative predictive factor in pemetrexed therapy.

26277606|t|Molecular factors become more meaningful when considering a relevant treatment option for cancer patients. Studies carried out on first-line pemetrexed/platinum treated patients seem to confirm usefulness of some factors such as thymidylate synthase expression, but in pemetrexed monotherapy group there is still very little relevant information. It is also worth mentioning that patients who receive second or further lines of chemotherapy usually have worse prognosis than those who are treated with first-line. Therefore, based on our study, it appears that the studied genetic factors may have high predictive and prognostic value (as high as clinical factors). Our results show that analysis of VNTR polymorphism in TS gene, an inside G > C SNP in VNTRs and MTHFR gene 677C > T SNP might help in selecting a group of non-squamous NSCLC patients who will benefit significantly from pemetrexed monotherapy, but in order to evaluate properly the usefulness of the chosen molecular factors more large-scale and prospective studies on more representative groups are needed.

26868515|t|The incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), commonly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, is increasing worldwide. However, the specific mechanisms that mediate the progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis remain largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate the timedependent changes of triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the blood and liver over 24 weeks in high-fat diet-induced obese rats with NAFLD and to clarify the role of high FFA levels in the progression of liver injury.

26868515|a|

26868515|t|The visceral fat/weight and liver/body weight ratios were higher in both the HFD and Acipimox groups than in the Control group. The TG and FFA concentrations in blood and liver were increased in the HFD group and associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and macro/microvesicular steatosis on hepatic fragments. Although the TG levels in the liver were similar between the HFD and Acipimox groups (p > 0.05), the FFA concentrations in the blood and liver were much lower in the latter group (p < 0.05). The Acipimox group showed normal ALT and MDA levels as well as less severe hepatic histological changes than did the HFD group (NAFLD activity score: 2.14 ± 0.14, 2.43 ± 0.20 and 2.63 ± 0.26 at 8, 16 and 24 weeks, respectively; p < 0.05 versus the HFD group at 24 weeks). The diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) protein levels were similar between the HFD and Acipimox groups (p > 0.05), but the protein expression level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a) was higher in the Acipimox group.

26868515|t|Conclusions
26868515|a|

26868515|t|Liver TG accumulation does not cause cellular injury in the liver; rather, FFAs or their metabolites are responsible for liver injury via increased oxidative stress. It is suggested that the therapeutic efforts to prevent non-alcoholic liver injury progression should be focused on reducing the burden of fatty acids transported to the liver or those being synthesized in the liver.

26868515|t|Background
26868515|a|

26868515|t|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has rapidly become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Clinical epidemiological data indicate that the prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 20 % to 30 % in Western countries and is 15 % in Asian countries [1]. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of histological findings ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis, and steatohepatitis can eventually progress to cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma [2, 3]. By some estimates, 10 ~ 20 % of patients with simple steatosis will convert into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [4] and 1.5 % to 3 % will develop advanced liver fibrosis [5], which seriously threatens the health of patients. Thus, to reduce the development of NASH and liver fibrosis/ cirrhosis, it is necessary to explore the pathophysiology and risk factors that influence the progression from simple fatty liver to NASH and to formulate early intervention strategies.
26868515|a|

26868515|t|Although the model of the “two-hit theory” is widely accepted to explain the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the specific mechanisms that mediate the progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and those that lead the maintenance of simple steatosis in some patients are poorly understood. The presence of steatosis is a prerequisite for NASH, but it is not causal for the development of NAFLD. Some recent studies have found that lipid accumulation in the liver may be a protective mechanism for patients with obesity/insulin resistance/elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) [6, 7]. Hepatocytes, exposure to high levels of circulating FFAs, and stored FFAs in the form of triglycerides (TGs) may ease FFA-induced oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, thereby preventing further hepatocellular damage. However, whether elevated FFA levels in the bloodstream play a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and whether lowering plasma and liver FFA levels can exert a protective effect on hepatocytes remains unclear.

26868515|t|Thus, to clarify the role of high FFA concentration in the progression of NAFLD, we induced NAFLD in rats using a high-fat diet and observed the time-dependent changes of TG, FFAs, liver enzymes, oxidative stress levels, and the protein expression levels related to TG synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, we utilized acipimox, a lipolysis inhibitor, to reduce blood FFA levels [8, 9] and determined whether reduced FFA levels had a protective effect on the liver.

26868515|t|Eight-week-old male Wistar rats weighing 270 ± 10 g were obtained from the animal resources centre (Sichuan University, China). All of the protocols were approved by the Ethic Committee of West China Hospital, and the animals were handled according to the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care.” The animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with controlled room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) and had access to food and water ad libitum. After an adaptation period of 1 week, the rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) the Control group (n = 30), fed standard rat chow; (2) the High-fat diet (HFD) group (n = 30), fed high-fat chow; and (3) the Acipimox group (n = 30), fed high-fat chow plus acipimox (100 mg/kg/day, ig). The percentages of grams and energy of the macronutrients in the diets are listed in Table 1. Body weight was measured weekly during the feeding period and compared with liver weight and visceral fat mass after the animals were sacrificed.

Blood samples were obtained from the heart by cardiac puncture, and serum samples were preserved at −80 °C for biochemical analyses as described below. Liver samples were weighed and processed for biochemical and histopathological studies and western blotting analysis. Abdominal visceral fat (including perirenal, epididymal, and mesenteric fat) was collected and weighed.

Coded sections were examined for histopathological changes by an experienced pathologist. Liver steatosis and NAFLD activity scores were semi-quantitatively evaluated as previously reported [12]. In brief, steatosis scores were defined as follows: score 0, presence of intrahepatic fat droplets in <5 % of hepatocytes; score 1, presence of intrahepatic fat droplets in 5–33 % of hepatocytes; score 2, presence of intrahepatic fat droplets in 33–66 % of hepatocytes; and score 3, presence of intrahepatic fat droplets in >67 % of hepatocytes. The NAFLD activity score is the sum of three equal weighted features: steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3) and hepatocellular ballooning (0–2).

The homogenates were centrifuged to collect the supernatants. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After being blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin in PBST at room temperature for 2 h, the membranes were incubated with anti-DGAT2 antibodies (rabbit anti-DGAT2; 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-CPT-1a antibodies (rabbit anti-CPT-1a; 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the membranes were washed three times with PBST and incubated with the relevant secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:5000; ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) for 90 min. β-actin (mouse anti-β-actin; 1:500; ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) was used as the loading control. The intensity was measured using Quantity One densitometric software (Bio-Rad).

This phenomenon was more significant at the end of 16 and 24 weeks, when body weight, visceral fat mass, and the visceral fat/weight ratio in both the HFD and Acipimox groups were all markedly increased compared with the corresponding values in the Control group (p < 0.05). The liver/body weight ratio in the Control group did not change with time, whereas it was much higher in the HFD and Acipimox groups (p < 0.05). At 24 weeks, rats in the Acipimox group exhibited lower visceral fat mass and a lower visceral fat/weight ratio than did the rats in the age-matched HFD group, and no significant differences were observed between the HFD and Acipimox groups with respect to body weight or the liver/body weight ratio during the study period (p > 0.05).

26868515|t|To understand the potential in vivo mechanisms that induced the changes in liver TG and FFA levels, we measured the hepatic protein expression levels of DGAT2, a TG synthesis rate-limiting enzyme, and the FFA oxidation-related enzyme CPT-1a. The HFD and Acipimox groups exhibited pronounced increases in DGAT2 protein level compared with the Control group. At the end of 16 and 24 weeks, the DGAT2 protein expression level had increased by 61 % and 39 % (HFD group) and by 48 % and 58 % (Acipimox group), respectively. No significant differences were observed in the DGAT2 protein level between the HFD and Acipimox groups at any time point. The protein expression level of CPT-1a was markedly reduced in the HFD group compared with the Control group at 24 weeks, although it did not differ significantly between the two groups at 8 and 16 weeks. The hepatic CPT-1a concentration can be effectively maintained by acipimox feeding and was similar between the Acipimox and Control groups (Fig. 2).

26868515|t|Discussion
26868515|a|

26868515|t|At present, numerous dietary and/or genetic methods can be used to induce animal models, which can simulate the human condition of NAFLD in many aspects [13]. An HFD is one of these methods. In addition to hepatic steatosis, an HFD can often induce insulin resistance, lipid metabolism disorders, and other metabolic syndrome components with pathophysiology that is more similar to that observed in human NAFLD than that generated by other animal models of NAFLD [13, 14]. In this study, we fed eight-week-old male Wistar rats high-fat chow, and after 8 to 24 weeks of dietary treatment, the rats in the HFD group exhibited increased body weight, visceral fat mass, visceral fat/body weight ratio and liver/body weight ratio when compared with the levels in the age-matched control rats. HFD treatment also caused significant increments in the serum TC, TG level, elevated hepatic TG content and marked lipid droplet deposition in the liver sections, suggesting that the model of obesity accompanied by NAFLD was successfully induced in this study.

26868515|t|It is interesting to note that after 8 weeks of dietary treatment, the HFD group exhibited a 3.4-fold increase in serum TG level and a 4.3-fold increase in hepatic TG content compared with the levels in control rats. However, the increase in serum FFAs was only 48 %, and no significant change in hepatic FFA content was observed in HFD-fed rats compared with normal chow-fed rats. These findings suggest that for the first 8 weeks of the HFD, circulating FFAs were normally converted to TGs in the liver and were stored in adipose tissue, the liver, and other tissues, resulting in increases in body weight and fat mass. At this time, the liver enzyme levels were normal, although the liver/body weight ratio was increased and the liver tissue sections indicated microvesicular steatosis, which are consistent with signs of fatty liver.

26868515|t|As the HFD treatment progressed, this trend was reversed. By 24 weeks, the increase in serum TG level in the HFD group was only 2.2-fold that of normal rats, whereas the hepatic TG content was only increased 2.4-fold compared with normal rats. However, the serum FFA levels were 2.7 times higher and the liver FFA content increased by 57 % in HFD-fed rats compared with the Control group. We propose that the main mechanism for these changes at 24 weeks might be due to an impaired ability of the liver to synthesize TGs, resulting in significantly elevated serum and hepatic FFAs levels. In addition, at this time point, the serum ALT levels in the HFD group were elevated, and the NAS was 3.5 ± 0.2, which suggest the possibility of steatohepatitis. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that hepatic TG deposition may not be harmful; rather, it may represent a protective mechanism against FFA-induced lipotoxic liver injury by storing FFAs in the form of TGs [6, 7, 15]. To further study the role of an elevated serum FFA level on NASH, we treated the HFD-fed rats with acipimox to reduce plasma FFA levels by inhibiting lipolysis. These results showed that the serum FFA and TG concentrations in the Acipimox group were significantly lower than those in the HFD group. Although the Acipimox group did not significantly differ from the HFD group in liver TG content, the content of hepatic FFAs in the Acipimox group was consistent with that of the Control group. Despite the increase in the liver/body weight ratio, the Acipimox group did not show any obvious changes in serum ALT levels, and the NAS in the Acipimox group was also lower than that of the HFD group, indicating that acipimox treatment reduced liver damage in HFD-fed rats. These findings suggest that increased serum and liver FFAs concentrations rather than TGs may be a key link between obesity and the development of NAFLD.

26868515|t|An elevated circulating FFA level is one of the clinical characteristics of subjects with obesity/metabolic syndrome. Under conditions of insulin resistance, defects in the β-oxidation of FFAs are observed. Elevated FFA levels in the liver can cause hepatocyte injury via the formation of various toxic metabolites, such as ceramides, diacylglycerols, and lysophosphatidylcholine [16]. These metabolites can result in mitochondria dysfunction via multiple methods, such as inhibiting the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain [17], activating NADPH oxidase, or depolarising the mitochondrial membrane [18, 19], which can result in increased ROS production, thereby enhancing oxidative stress-induced liver injury. It has been shown that MDA, an index of oxidative stress, can damage cells and tissues, whereas GSH-Px, one of the body’s endogenous antioxidants, can protect hepatocytes against oxidative damage via chemical or enzymatic reactions. In our study, hepatic MDA levels were obviously elevated and progressively increased in the HFD group over 24 weeks compared with the Control group. Furthermore, the decrease in hepatic GSH-Px activity occurred at 8 weeks in the HFD group. The hepatic MDA level in the Acipimox group was similar to that of the control group and was markedly lower than that of the corresponding HFD group. Taken together, these findings suggest that a high serum FFA level may induce steatohepatitis by enhancing oxidative stress. When the level of FFAs is lowered with acipimox, hepatic oxidative stress levels decrease, thereby reducing liver damage and delaying the occurrence of NASH.

26868515|t|In the NAFLD state, the synthesis of hepatic TGs was increased. Although the classic “two hit” theory considers hepatic TG deposition to be a prerequisite for the development of NASH, emerging studies have suggested that TG accumulation may only be an “innocent bystander” or even a protective mechanism in the progression of NAFLD to NASH [7, 20]. In our study, the serum and liver FFA levels progressively increased in the HFD group over 24 weeks, but TG accumulation in the HFD group markedly decreased from 4.3-fold at 8 weeks to 2.4-fold at 24 weeks compared with the Control group, indicating that the ability of the liver to synthesize TGs is impaired with progression of the disease.

26868515|t|To further explore the potential mechanism that induces the change in liver TG content, we measured the hepatic protein expression levels of the TG synthesis-related enzyme DGAT2. DGAT2 is the rate-limiting enzyme in TG synthesis and plays an important role in the development of fatty liver diseases [21]. Previous studies have shown that the levels of DGAT2 mRNA/protein are elevated in the NAFLD state [22, 23]. The results of the present study are consistent with those of previous studies. Compared with the Control group, the HFD group exhibited a pronounced increase in DGAT2 protein level. Regarding the HFD group, no significant change in the expression of DGAT2 protein was observed during the course of the disease, and thus we speculate that an impairment of TG synthesis due to a decrease in DGAT2 protein expression was unlikely.

26868515|t|It is well known that CPT-1a is a gated enzyme that regulates mitochondrial β-oxidation in the liver. Previous studies have revealed conflicting results regarding the change in CPT-1a in NAFLD [24, 25]. The present study indicated that CPT-1a expression was similar between the HFD and Control groups at 8 weeks. By 24 weeks, CPT-1a expression was markedly decreased in HFD-fed rats. After treatment with acipimox, the level of CPT-1a protein expression was similar to that of the Control group, suggesting that during the progression of the disease, the oxidative capacity of mitochondrial fatty acids declines and that lowering hepatic FFAs levels may maintain the function of mitochondrial lipid oxidation, thus maintaining the balance of energy metabolism. We speculate that the decline in the oxidative capacity of mitochondrial lipids and oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage could jointly cause a decrease in ATP synthesis, resulting in an energy deficit in TG synthesis and subsequently impaired TG synthesis.

26868515|t|Finally, our study demonstrated that declining elevated serum FFAs levels were beneficial in preventing the conversion of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as weight loss in obese patients, reduced carbohydrate intake, especially intake of high glycemic and high fructose foods, and aerobic exercise should be first-line choices. A number of agents, such as fibrates and nicotinic acid, can be used to reduce serum FFAs levels if nonpharmacologic interventions fail. In addition, nutraceuticals and functional food ingredients (such as fish oil and soyabean) that are beneficial to the lipid profile may reduce the risk of fatty liver by acting in parallel to pharmacologic therapy, as adjuvants in case of failure or in situations where pharmacologic therapy cannot be used [24, 26].

26868515|t|The main limitation of the current study is that we failed to induce NASH, mainly due to the limitations of the HFD-induced NAFLD model [13]. Although this drawback limits the extension of our results, we observed that the degree of liver damage was gradually increased as the HFD feeding period progressed via changes in NAS and serum ALT levels, and the hepatic FFA content and oxidative stress level showed pronounced changes. Therefore, we speculate that these changes should be more pronounced when the disease progresses to NASH.

26868515|t|Conclusions
26868515|a|

26868515|t|This study indicated that during the development of NAFLD, FFA levels increased significantly and were accompanied by an increase in oxidative stress. Then a reduction in FFA levels was observed, which can effectively reduce oxidative stress and liver injury. These findings suggest that although liver TG deposition is the primary characteristic of NAFLD, it may be an “innocent bystander” or a protective mechanism in the development of NAFLD. However, FFAs and their metabolites are likely, at least in part, the pivotal factor that promotes the development of NAFLD. Future studies are needed to obtain definitive results regarding this issue. If this is the case, then treatments should focus on how to effectively reduce the lipotoxicity of FFAs rather than inhibiting the deposition of hepatic TGs.

26977188|t|Introduction
26977188|a|

26977188|t|Asymmetric organocatalysis has been demonstrated to be an effective and versatile strategy in facilitating a variety of organic transformations over the past decade, and numerous catalytic asymmetric reactions have been developed with various activation modes [1–6]. In this realm, chiral bifunctional catalysts, possessing two active sites, have captured tremendous attention in particular due to their unique ability of the simultaneous activation of the nucleophile and the electrophile in the same transition state [7–11]. Among them, chiral bifunctional thioureas bearing multiple hydrogen-bond donors have been successfully used as chiral organocatalysts for the asymmetric Michael addition and Mannich reactions [12–14]. Meanwhile, the Henry reaction is one of the most important carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions that provides straightforward access to β-nitroalcohols, which can be further transformed into amino-alcohols, amino acids and carbonyl compounds [15]. Much attention has been devoted to the development of an efficient catalytic asymmetric version of this reaction from readily accessible nitroalkanes and carbonyl compounds [16], such as aldehydes [17–19], α-ketoesters [20], α-ketophosphonates [21–22], fluoromethyl ketones [23–24] and isatins [25–26]. Despite these significant advances described above, the use of more challenging ketones with heterocyclic structures as Henry acceptors has remained relatively less explored. In this context, developing a new Henry reaction for the construction of the useful and versatile β-nitroalcohol scaffolds is still desirable.

26977188|t|Pyrrole skeletons represent an important class of heterocycles and are frequently found in many biologically active molecules and natural products [27–28]. Particularly, 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-1H-pyrrol-2(3H)-one derivatives exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities [29]. The reaction of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones with various nucleophiles should be a straightforward way to access diverse and interesting 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-1H-pyrrol-2(3H)-ones. A survey of the literature reveals that the study of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones is mainly focused on three-component spiro-heterocyclization reactions [30–32]. However, for the catalytic asymmetric transformation, only one example of an aldol reaction of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones with ketones has been reported so far (Scheme 1) [33]. Recently, our group developed a chiral bifunctional multiple hydrogen-bond amine-thiourea-catalyzed Michael reaction of acetyl phosphonates with nitroolefins, giving a series of β-substituted nitro compounds with excellent stereoselectivity [34]. Therefore, as part of our research program aimed at establishing new methods for the construction of quaternary stereocenters [35–37], we envisioned that the Henry reaction of nitroalkanes with 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones should take place with a chiral bifunctional amine-thiourea catalyst, leading to 3-hydroxy-3-nitromethyl-1H-pyrrol-2(3H)-ones bearing quaternary stereocenters (Scheme 1) [14]. Notably, this work represents the first example of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones used as Henry acceptors for the asymmetric reaction. Herein, we report our preliminary results on this subject.

26977188|t|Results and Discussion
26977188|a|

26977188|t|We started our studies with the reaction of ethyl 1-benzyl-4,5-dioxo-2-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (1a) and nitromethane (2a) in the presence of various chiral bifunctional organocatalysts 3a–e in dichloromethane (Table 1). As expected, the reaction proceeded and gave the desired product 4a in 18% yield and 28% ee with cinchonidine and L-valine-based catalyst 3a (Table 1, entry 1). The bifunctional, thiourea-tertiary amine catalyst 3b, derived from quinine and L-valine, furnished a similar result to catalyst 3a (Table 1, entry 2). Next, the reaction was attempted with catalyst 3c derived from L-phenylalanine and catalyst 3d derived from L-phenylglycine, and improvements in enantioselectivity were observed (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). Changing L-phenylalanine to D-phenylalanine furnished catalyst 3e, and the enantioselectivity was improved to 61% ee (Table 1, entry 5). Having identified 3e as the best catalyst, we undertook a solvent screening for this transformation with 20 mol % 3e at 30 °C (Table 1, entries 6–12). Arenes such as toluene and mesitylene gave relatively lower ee values (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). In contrast, the reactions in ethers gave improved yield with slightly increased enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 8–10). However, strong polar solvents such as acetonitrile and ethyl acetate proved inferior to this Henry reaction (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). The solvent survey revealed that THF was the suitable solvent in terms of the yield and enantioselectivity (Table 1, entry 8).

26977188|t|To further optimize the reaction conditions, the substituent at the nitrogen atom in 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones 1 and the substrate concentration were investigated. The results are summarized in Table 2. It was found that an isopropyl group furnished a better yield and ee value than a benzyl group (Table 2, entry 2 vs entry 1). Changing the isopropyl group to a methyl group decreased the enantioselectivity (Table 2, entry 3). To enhance the reactivity of the substrate, we also tried to introduce some electron-withdrawing substituents on the nitrogen atom. However, we could not obtain the desired substrates. Afterwards, upon the investigation of substrate concentration (Table 2, entries 4 and 5), it was found that increasing the substrate concentration could slightly increase the yield with unchanged enantioselectivity (Table 2, entry 4). Ultimately, the effects of the reaction temperature and the additive were also examined and no improved results were obtained (Table 2, entries 6–8). Based on these observations, the most appropriate conditions for the Henry reaction could be established: 1 equiv of 1a and 10 equiv of 2a with 20 mol % catalyst 3e in 1.0 mL THF at 30 °C (Table 2, entry 4).

26977188|t|Under the optimal reaction conditions, the substrate scope and the limitation of this organocatalytic Henry reaction were explored. The results are summarized in Table 3. First, we investigated the effects of the alkyl ester of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones 1. The replacement of the ethyl group by either a methyl or a butyl group had only a slight effect on the ee value but an obvious effect on the yield (Table 3, entries 1 and 2 vs Table 2, entry 4). After introducing different substituent groups on the phenyl ring of substrate 1, it was observed that the reactions take place, and the corresponding products in 44–73% yield with up to 73% ee were furnished. This was true regardless of the electronic nature and position of the substituents on the phenyl ring (Table 3, entries 3–10). When the substituent was in the ortho-position of the phenyl ring of the R2 group, a diastereoselectivity was observed that may be due to the steric hindrance of ortho substituents led to the atropisomers (Table 3, entry 3). A similar result was observed for the bulky 1-naphthyl group (Table 3, entry 11). The reaction was also performed with a 2-thienyl residue and the desired product was obtained in 51% yield and 71% ee (Table 3, entry 10). In addition, substrate 1o with no substituent on the nitrogen atom gave the desired product in 41% and 48% ee (Table 3, entry 12). The introduction of a phenyl group on the nitrogen atom had a negative effect on the reaction (Table 3, entry 13). Nitroethane was also used to react with 1H-pyrrole-2,3-dione 1b, and a good diastereoselectivity was achieved with an unfavorable yield and ee value (Table 3, entry 14). For the substrates with methoxy groups on the phenyl rings, the reaction gave relatively better results (Table 3, entries 4 and 7). We also tested the substrates 1q and 1r containing a methyl ester, and acceptable results were obtained (Table 3, entries 15 and 16). The absolute configuration of the major isomer 4i was unambiguously determined to be S by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 1) [38]. The configurations of the other products were assigned by analogy.

26977188|t|On the basis of our experimental results and the related reports about the bifunctional activation mode of nitromethane with different electrophiles [14,17,39], we propose a possible model to explain the stereochemistry of this transformation. As shown in Fig. 2, nitromethane is activated by the tertiary amine to form the nitro enolate. Simultaneously, the 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones 1 are orientated by the multiple hydrogen bonds of the catalyst. Thus, the nitro enolate attacks the keto carbonyl group of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones (to the si-face) to furnish the corresponding product with S-configuration (Fig. 2).

26977188|a|

26977188|t|In conclusion, we have developed an asymmetric Henry reaction of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones with a chiral bifunctional amine-thiourea possessing multiple hydrogen-bond donors as the catalyst. With the developed protocol, a range of 3-hydroxy-3-nitromethyl-1H-pyrrol-2(3H)-ones bearing quaternary stereocenters were obtained in good yield (up to 75%) and with moderate to good enantioselectivity (up to 73% ee). A possible transition-state model, characterized by the bifunctional catalyst acting as a multiple hydrogen-bond donor, is also proposed. The application of 1H-pyrrole-2,3-diones in the catalytic asymmetric reactions for the preparation of biologically relevant compounds is currently underway.

26848655|t|Effects of Atorvastatin Dose and Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors on Renal Function Changes over Time in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease: A Prospective Observational Study
26848655|a|
26848655	11	23	Atorvastatin	Chemical	MESH:D000069059

26848655|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and statins are widely used in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Our aim was to compare changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over time in subjects with stable CAD according to atorvastatin dose and concomitant use of ACEI. We studied 78 men with stable CAD referred for an elective coronary angiography who attained the then-current guideline-recommended target level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol below 2.5 mmol/L in a routine fasting lipid panel on admission and were receiving atorvastatin at a daily dose of 10–40 mg for ≥3 months preceding the index hospitalization. Due to an observational study design, atorvastatin dosage was not intentionally modified for other reasons. GFR was estimated during index hospitalization and at about one year after discharge from our center. Irrespective of ACEI use, a prevention of kidney function loss was observed only in those treated with the highest atorvastatin dose. In 38 subjects on ACEI, both of the higher atorvastatin doses were associated with increasing beneficial effects on GFR changes (mean ± SEM: −4.2 ± 2.4, 1.1 ± 1.6, 5.2 ± 2.4 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for the 10-mg, 20-mg and 40-mg atorvastatin group, respectively, p = 0.02 by ANOVA; Spearman’s rho = 0.50, p = 0.001 for trend). In sharp contrast, in 40 patients without ACEI, no significant trend effect was observed across increasing atorvastatin dosage (respective GFR changes: −1.3 ± 1.0, −4.7 ± 2.1, 4.8 ± 3.6 mL/min per 1.73 m2, p = 0.02 by ANOVA; rho = 0.08, p = 0.6 for trend). The results were substantially unchanged after adjustment for baseline GFR or time-dependent variations of LDL cholesterol. Thus, concomitant ACEI use appears to facilitate the ability of increasing atorvastatin doses to beneficially modulate time-dependent changes in GFR in men with stable CAD.

26848655|t|1. Introduction
26848655|a|

26848655|t|As early as 2001, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies by Fried et al. [1] suggested the ability of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), to slow down renal function decline in patients with renal diseases. Five years later, a meta-analysis by Sandhu et al. [2] also identified renal benefits of statins, including a small yet significant reduction in the rate of kidney function loss, especially in populations with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, according to some recent meta-analyses, despite a lower risk of CV events in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjects on statins, renoprotective statin effects were unclear with a significant heterogeneity across the included CKD studies [3,4]. Nikolic et al. [5] have recently reported a beneficial effect of statins on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) changes only for between one and three years of statin therapy in CKD. In contrast to these inconsistent results, a meta-analysis of controlled studies in CKD patients treated with atorvastatin revealed an evidence of the atorvastatin-induced renoprotection that was independent of follow-up duration and persisted after exclusion of any single trial from the analysis including the largest Treating to New Targets (TNT) study [6]. These discrepancies could be partially linked to a dosage-dependence of renal benefits of statins, recently demonstrated irrespective of the presence of CKD [7,8].

26848655|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are recommended in CKD due to their well-recognized ability to reduce proteinuria and delay renal function decline. In addition, ACEI should be considered for CV event prevention even in patients with stable angina and without coexistent strong indications for this class of drugs, i.e., left ventricular systolic dysfunction, diabetes or hypertension [9,10]. However, ACEI were used by only about 28% of the subjects participating in the TNT trial that demonstrated greater improvements in GFR over five years in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) randomized to 80-mg atorvastatin vs. 10-mg atorvastatin [11]. Of note, in the Protection Against Nephropathy in Diabetes with Atorvastatin (PANDA) trial two-year GFR changes were similar in type 2 diabetics with early nephropathy allocated 80-mg and 10-mg atorvastatin, all of whom were receiving either ACEI or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) [12].

26848655|t|Therefore, we hypothesized that dose-dependent effects of atorvastatin on renal function might be modified by ACEI use. Thus, the aim of our observational study was to compare GFR changes over time in men with stable CAD according to the dose of atorvastatin and concomitant usage of ACEI.

26848655|t|Out of 78 study subjects, 40 patients were receiving no ACEI, largely due to a history of adverse renal side-effects, which resulted in a significantly higher GFR in those with ACEI (69.5 ± 2.7 vs. 43.5 ± 2.0 mL/min per 1.73 m2, p < 0.001).

26848655|t|By multivariate analysis, a change in GFR was positively related to the treatment with 40-mg atorvastatin. In addition, we found a significant interaction between ACEI use and the therapy with 20-mg atorvastatin (Table 3). Accordingly, in patients with ACEI we observed a higher GFR change in the 20-mg atorvastatin group compared to the 10-mg atorvastatin group, whereas in those not receiving ACEI an increase in GFR was found exclusively for the 40-mg group (Figure 2). The results were substantially unchanged after inclusion of baseline GFR or time-dependent variations of LDL cholesterol and mean blood pressure into the model.

26848655|t|3. Discussion
26848655|a|

26848655|t|Our salient finding was the ability of ACEI use to modulate the relation between atorvastatin dose of 10–40 mg daily and GFR changes over a mean follow-up of 12 months in men with stable CAD. In the study subjects on ACEI, the use of atorvastatin was associated with increasing beneficial effects on kidney function beginning from an atorvastatin dose of 20 mg, whereas in those receiving no ACEI, no significant trend effect was found. Additionally, time-dependent changes in GFR appeared independent of concomitant longitudinal variations of LDL cholesterol or blood pressure.

26848655|t|3.1. Mechanistic Considerations
26848655|a|

26848655|t|Our findings may be indicative of the relevance of cholesterol-independent pleiotropic statin actions for the renal benefit achieved with atorvastatin. Admittedly, cholesterol lowering through HMG-CoA reductase inhibition is the principal mechanism of statin actions; however, because cholesterol levels were similar in patients treated with three atorvastatin doses, a hypothetical role of cholesterol-independent pathways can be hypothesized. Beyond cholesterol reduction, pleiotropic statin effects include attenuation of endothelial dysfunction as well as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, antifibrotic and sympatholytic activity [5,13,14], all of which were also shown for ACEI [15]. Moreover, adding a statin to ACEI ameliorated renal function, reduced proteinuria and prevented glomerulosclerosis, tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis in several experimental models of kidney disease [16,17,18,19]. Additionally, statins are able to down-regulate angiotensin II type 1 receptors [20,21], whose density is known to increase in patients on ACEI. Thus, it does not seem implausible to assume that converging intercellular pathways mediating ACEI and statin activities could be responsible for the association of favorable GFR changes with statin therapy at a lower dose of atorvastatin in ACEI users compared with those receiving no ACEI. This concept appears much more likely than altered atorvastatin metabolism due to a difference in renal function according to ACEI use because the drug is eliminated primarily in the bile and no dose adjustment is required in CKD [22].

26848655|t|Admittedly, it is doubtful whether long-term effects of statin therapy on kidney structure in animal models of CKD [16,17,18,19] could translate into measurable effects on GFR within a relatively short follow-up in the present study. Therefore, we can hypothesize that our findings might rather be linked to hemodynamic statin actions. This concept was also proposed by Athyros et al. [23] as an explanation for early increase in GFR already at the sixth week of treatment with the starting atorvastatin dose of 10 mg/day in subjects with established CAD and dyslipidemia participating in the GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary heart disease Evaluation (GREACE) study, with the greatest benefit in those with early renal dysfunction. It is noteworthy that ACEI—shown to delay CKD progression on a long-term basis [15]—did not independently influence GFR changes in the present study.

26848655|t|Statins may exert renal hemodynamics via preglomerular vasodilation [24], a likely consequence of an increased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), all the more because short-term (six weeks) treatment with rosuvastatin potentiated the dependence of renal plasma flow on NO generation in patients with hypercholesterolemia, with a trend towards improved basal NO activity already after three-day therapy [25]. Of note, in healthy subjects the dependence of fractional sodium excretion on the l-arginine–NO pathway was more pronounced after five-day treatment with 80 mg atorvastatin daily [26]. In addition, GFR improved after a four-week therapy with 40 mg simvastatin per day in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which was associated with improved endothelium-dependent dilation in the forearm [27]. On the other hand, in subjects with type 2 diabetes, administration of atorvastatin (10 or 80 mg/day) for 30 weeks neither improved impaired flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery [28] nor affected urinary markers of systemic NO generation and oxidative stress [29] as compared to patients randomized to placebo.

26848655|t|Elevated bioavailability of renal NO produces not only the dilation of glomerular arterioles, but also local NO generated in the juxtaglomerular apparatus can antagonize the angiotensin II-dependent enhancement of vasoconstrictory responses of afferent arterioles via tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) [30]. In keeping with this concept, Song et al. [31] have recently demonstrated augmented TGF responsiveness associated with increased superoxide generation and decreased NO formation by neuronal NO synthase in the macula densa in a model of hypertension induced with slow-pressor infusion of angiotensin II in mice. Furthermore, Park et al. [32] observed the ability of rosuvastatin to protect against angiotensin II-induced inflammatory and profibrotic activation and renal injury in a transgenic model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and target-organ damage. Finally, atorvastatin attenuated renal oxidative stress, exerted anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, prevented glomerulosclerosis and upregulated renal endothelial NO synthase in a rat model of salt-sensitive hypertension associated with increased angiotensin II-dependent activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases [33].

26848655|t|Thus, we can hypothesize that restoration of renal NO activity on statins could be especially beneficial under ACE inhibition because it might possibly maintain an equilibrium between the angiotensin II-mediated postglomerular vasoconstriction and the TGF-dependent preglomerular vasoconstriction, thereby preventing excessive GFR reductions on ACEI.

26848655|t|3.2. Clinical Implications
26848655|a|

26848655|t|Irrespective of these speculative mechanistic considerations, the results of the present study may translate into bedside, although the study population, with a prevalence of diabetes of only 25%, could be considered at low risk for CKD progression upon exclusion of subjects with heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and uncontrolled hypertension. In the clinical practice, ACEI and ARB tend to be underused in patients with increasing stages of CKD due to perceived safety concerns about adverse renal effects of these drugs [34], which was also evident in our study group. Therefore, subjects with CKD, who are receiving no ACEI therapy, are devoid of a valuable tool in the medical armamentarium aimed at slowing down CKD progression, being thus more dependent on alternative strategies to protect against GFR deterioration. Accordingly, since we were able to detect the ability of 40-mg atorvastatin to prevent a fall of GFR over a one-year follow-up period in ACEI non-users, higher atorvastatin doses may be a reasonable option in this clinical setting not only to attenuate the risk of adverse CV outcome but also to prevent renal function decline.

26848655	1005	1017	atorvastatin	Chemical	MESH:D000069059

26848655|t|Furthermore, the ability of statin to improve GFR appears augmented in CKD because, in the TNT study, the mean percentage increase from baseline GFR was higher among participants with a baseline GFR below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 both for the patients allocated 80-mg atorvastatin (9.9% vs. 7.6%) and in the 10-mg arm (6.6% vs. 5.2%) [11]. In addition, relative GFR improvements associated with titrate-to-goal regimens of atorvastatin (10 to 80 mg per day) over a regimen of “usual care” were more pronounced in individuals with established CAD and coexistent CKD compared to those with a normal renal function in the GREACE (15% [GFR < 77 mL/min] vs. 3% [GFR > 77 mL/min]; mean atorvastatin dose: 24 mg/day) [23] and Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events (ALLIANCE) trial (4.5% [CKD] vs. 1.1% [no CKD]; mean atorvastatin dose: 40.5 mg/day) [35].

26848655|t|In some analogy to these reports, in the patients treated with 40-mg atorvastatin, we observed a higher relative increase in GFR in those without ACEI (about 12%) vs. ACEI users (about 7.5%), whereas average GFR was lower by almost 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in the former. However, GFR changes according to ACEI/statin use were previously reported only in a post hoc analysis of the GREACE study, being similar during a three-year follow-up in patients taking the combination of a statin (mainly atorvastatin) plus an ACEI and those receiving a statin without ACEI [36]. With regard to the TNT [11] and ALLIANCE [35] study, renal effects of atorvastatin according to the treatment with ACEI/ARB have not been reported so far.

26848655|t|It needs to be acknowledged that we were not able to make comparisons with the reference to patients without statins. However, assuming the notion of the hypothetical ACEI–statins interactions in terms of GFR changes, the magnitude of GFR improvements over time can possibly be perceived as a renal “mirror” of additive beneficial effects of ACEI and statins on clinical outcome, previously demonstrated in patients with CAD [36] and recently in diabetic subjects with critical limb ischemia [37]. Moreover, the proposed concept can also indirectly imply a higher ability of lower atorvastatin doses to produce beneficial effects on renal function in ACEI users vs. non-users, which was found in the present study. Of note, in a placebo-controlled study, Bianchi et al. [38] observed that adding a mean dose of 15 mg of atorvastatin daily to ACEI or ARB prevented one-year renal function decline and reduced proteinuria in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD due to idiopathic chronic glomerulonephritis. Unfortunately, the proportional use of ACEI and ARB was not reported by the Lipid Lowering and Onset of Renal Disease (LORD) trial investigators who observed no statistical difference in 2.5-year GFR changes between CKD subjects of various etiology randomized to 10-mg atorvastatin and placebo [39].

26848655|t|First, a relatively low number of the patients and observational study design are major study limitations and a randomized assignment of the subjects to ACEI therapy and different atorvastatin doses would be more appropriate. However, we analyzed only patients who were already on atorvastatin (with or without ACEI) for at least three months preceding the index hospitalization and attained the then-current guideline-recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol in a routine fasting lipid panel on admission; Second, we did not routinely estimate proteinuria and indices of calcium/phosphorus metabolism, also known to affect CKD progression; Finally, because study subjects were followed on an outpatient basis, we were able to collect exclusively a self-reported history of medication use after discharge from our department.

26848655|t|4.1. Patients
26848655|a|

26848655|t|We studied men with stable CAD referred for an elective diagnostic coronary angiography who exhibited the presence of at least one epicardial coronary narrowing of ≥70% and were being treated in accordance with current practice guidelines including aspirin and statin for ≥3 preceding months. All patients underwent a complex percutaneous coronary angioplasty in our center. As described previously, a wide set of exclusion criteria was applied to reduce the heterogeneity of the study population [40]. We had a priori excluded subjects with heart failure/left ventricular systolic dysfunction, significant valvular heart disease or congenital heart disease, arterial hypertension not adequately controlled by drugs, a history of acute coronary syndrome within the previous three months, major surgery in the past six months, GFR >120 or <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, evidence of abnormal liver function, contrast nephropathy during index hospitalization, relevant abnormalities in routine blood analysis, coexistent inflammatory or malignant diseases, and chronic medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or coxibs. In the present study, we analyzed only subjects who attained the then-current guideline-recommended target level of LDL cholesterol below 2.5 mmol/L [9,10] in a routine fasting lipid panel on admission and were receiving daily atorvastatin doses between 10 and 40 mg prior to the index hospitalization. Due to an observational study design, the doses of atorvastatin were not intentionally modified for other reasons in the analyzed patients. Out of 391 pre-screened patients, 282 were eliminated from the study on the basis of the above listed inclusion and exclusion criteria.

26848655|a|

26848655|t|After discharge from our department, patients underwent routine control visits in our outpatient clinic [41] and, if deemed necessary from clinical practice indications, re-hospitalizations in our center. In order to assess GFR changes over about a one-year follow-up, we recorded GFR—estimated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula [42]—during the index hospitalization and at 12 ± 3 months after discharge.
26848655|a|

26848655|t|We excluded from the study the patients in whom atorvastatin doses were changed and/or ACEI were permanently discontinued or introduced by an attending physician before the control visit. Among 109 eligible patients who were followed, 31 were eliminated from the final analysis because of a modification of the therapeutic regimen with regard to atorvastatin/ACEI after the index hospitalization, or due to loss to follow-up.

26848655|a|

26848655|t|Data are presented as means and SD or SEM for continuous variables or n (%) for categorical characteristics. In order to check univariate effects of atorvastatin dose and ACEI use on changes in GFR, ANOVA was applied with either drug dosage or ACEI therapy as a categorical predictor. Post hoc comparisons were done by Tukey’s test. The ANOVA assumptions, i.e., the accordance with a Gaussian distribution and uniformity of variance were tested by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Levene test, respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) were computed to assess univariate associations between, on the one side, changes in GFR, and on the other side, baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics as well as time-dependent changes of LDL cholesterol and mean blood pressure.

26848655|t|For GFR changes over time, testing for trend across increasing doses of atorvastatin was performed with Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients (rho) in the study subjects stratified according to ACEI use. Then, rho coefficients between those with and without ACEI were compared using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation because Myers and Sirois [43] demonstrated that treating rho coefficients as if they were Pearson’s coefficients was more robust than alternative approaches with respect to false rejection of a true null hypothesis. A p-value below 0.05 was inferred significant.
26848655|a|
26848655	72	84	atorvastatin	Chemical	MESH:D000069059

26848655|t|Then, in order to check whether the effects of atorvastatin dosage on renal function were affected by ACEI therapy, a generalized linear regression model was applied with a change in GFR as a dependent variable. Since preliminary analyses did not allow the assumption of monotonic relations between atorvastatin dose and the dependent variable across subgroups of the study subjects divided on the basis of ACEI use, we entered 20-mg and 40-mg doses of atorvastatin as separate categorical predictors. Then, effects of the both statin doses, ACEI use and interactions between ACEI usage and each of the two statin doses were estimated. Regression coefficients for these factors are equivalent to an effect on GFR in the patients exposed to a factor of interest with the reference to the patients without this exposure. In order to adjust for potential continuous confounders, we planned to enter into the model baseline characteristics for which the univariate p-value did not exceed 0.10. Additionally, to control for time-dependent changes in LDL cholesterol and mean blood pressure, the analyses were repeated with these covariates in the regression model. We also compared results of the two regression models with and without inclusion of baseline GFR as a potential confounder. We used this approach because, on the one hand, patients without ACEI exhibited significantly lower GFR due to a history of adverse renal effects and, on the other hand, the adjustment for baseline levels of a variable may result in a measurement error-dependent bias when searching for determinants of changes in this variable over time [44,45].

27160923|t|Unlike normal cells, cancer cells express high levels of phosphatidylserine on the extracellular leaflet of their cell membrane. Exploiting this characteristic, our lab developed a therapeutic agent that consists of the fusogenic protein, saposin C (SapC) which is embedded in dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) vesicles. These nanovesicles selectively target cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Here we review the data supporting use of SapC-DOPS to locate tumors for surgical resection or for treatment. In addition, there is important evidence suggesting that SapC-DOPS may also prove to be an effective novel cancer therapeutic reagent. Given that SapC-DOPS is easily labeled with lipophilic dyes, it has been combined with the far-red fluorescent dye, CellVue Maroon (CVM), for tumor targeting studies. We also have used contrast agents incorporated in the SapC-DOPS nanovesicles for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and review that data here. Administered intravenously, the fluorescently labeled SapC-DOPS traversed the blood–brain tumor barrier enabling identification of brain tumors. SapC-DOPS-CVM also detected a variety of other mouse tumors in vivo, rendering them observable by optical imaging using IVIS and multi-angle rotational optical imaging. Dye is detected within 30 min and remains within tumor for at least 7 days, whereas non-tumor tissues were unstained (some dye observed in the liver was transient, likely representing degradation products). Additionally, labeled SapC-DOPS ex vivo delineated tumors in human histological specimens. SapC-DOPS can also be labeled with contrast reagents for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In conclusion, labeled SapC-DOPS provides a convenient, specific, and nontoxic method for detecting tumors while concurrently offering a therapeutic benefit.

27160923|t|Phospholipids are arranged asymmetrically in cell membranes, with neutral phospholipids on the outer leaflet and anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (PS), located primarily on the inner leaflet of the membrane [1–3]. A translocase, the flippase complex, selective for PE and PS, is an ATP-dependent pump that catalyzes rapid inward migration of these phospholipids [1] to maintain this configuration. Collapse of this asymmetry is an early process in apoptosis that results in the translocation of PS to the exterior of the cell. In a normal cell undergoing apoptosis, the externalized PS serves as a trigger for phagocytes, particularly macrophages, to engulf the cell, minimizing inflammation [4, 5].

27160923|t|Although cancer cells and their associated tumor vasculature also exhibit a high level of PS on the outer leaflet [6–9], this externalized phospholipid is not associated with apoptosis. Critically, the mechanisms by which cancer cells actually resist phagocytosis remain incompletely understood [9]. Compared with non-malignant cells, expression of PS on the cell surface is a consistent marker of malignancy in both primary and metastatic cell lines [6–12]. In their study focused on difficult-to-treat primary cancers, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, and metastatic lesions, Riedl et al. [11] demonstrated the specificity of abundant externalized PS for malignant tumors. While virtually all cancer cells exhibit high external PS compared with normal cells, the quantity of surface PS varies widely among different cancer cells, even of the same type [10, 12]. The increase in surface PS has led to the use of a number of proteins or peptides that bind to PS to study apoptotic and tumor cells [2, 4, 13]; among these are annexin A5 (ANXA5), an endogenous anticoagulant protein, and lactadherin (MFGE8) [2, 14], a major glycoprotein in milk that promotes cellular adhesion. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies to PS have been generated that demonstrate anti-tumor activity [6, 15]. All of these have been conjugated to a number of markers to detect the location of PS.

27160923|t|In this review, we discuss Saposin C-Dioleoylphosphatidylserine (SapC-DOPS), a stable nanovesicle that specifically binds PS but, importantly, also has demonstrated therapeutic properties against a variety of cancer types. Given the specificity of SapC-DOPS for cells that have undergone neoplastic transformation and the resultant enhancement seen on imaging studies owing to the externalization of PS on cancer cells, we review this new paradigm for improved diagnosis and early detection of malignancy that may overcome some of the limitations of current imaging related to the cancer’s type and site or to other underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes and kidney disease).

27160923|t|Saposin C (SapC) is a small, fusogenic glycoprotein that is remarkably heat-stable and protease-resistant [16–19]. While SapC itself is non-enzymatic, it is an activator of lysosomal enzymes, particularly acid sphingomyelinase and acid beta-glucosidase, which catalyze the breakdown of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide into phosphocholine and ceramide, and glucose and ceramide, respectively [20–22]. Although the precise mechanism is unclear, this increase in ceramide levels may result in cell death, as ceramide has been previously implicated in apoptosis [23], possibly through the actions of caspases [24]. In order for SapC to activate these enzymes, it must bind the PS of the intracellular vesicles’ membranes. In vitro, at low pH, SapC and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) will spontaneously form nanovesicles with a mean diameter of approximately 200 nm (Fig. 1). The amino- and carboxyl termini of SapC are amphipathic helices that insert into the lipid bilayer, while the middle region is exposed to solvent. Conformational changes of SapC induced by PS interaction suggest a reorientation of the functional helical domains [25]. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of SapC-DOPS positively correlates with the level of surface PS: the higher the external PS, the more effectively SapC-DOPS [10, 12] will bind the cell and trigger the ceramide cascade, ultimately resulting in apoptosis (Fig. 2).

27160923|t|In our lab, the role of PS as a tumor marker has been validated repeatedly for a variety of cancer types [10, 24, 26–30]. In particular, the targeting of PS by SapC-DOPS was demonstrated to be a novel method to achieve accurate and effective identification of cancer cells. The validation of PS as a reliable tumor marker, coupled with the high affinity of SapC-DOPS for PS on a variety of cancer cell surfaces, provides a promising advancement for accurate detection of several cancer types.

27160923|t|The lipophilic properties of SapC-DOPS make it an ideal carrier of detection moieties, such as fluorescent markers or clinically applicable contrast agents (Fig. 3). Experiments coupling SapC-DOPS to the far-red fluorescent probe CellVue Maroon (CVM) have been performed to distinguish neoplastic tumor regions on histologic slides and individual patient-derived neoplastic cell lines, as well as in vivo [10, 24, 26–28, 31]. In several studies showing the specificity of this reagent, SapC-DOPS-CVM was internalized by live tumor cells but not normal cells, clearly delineating the tumor in tissue slices. A caveat of using histological slides is that their generation requires slicing the cells, so that SapC-DOPS or other PS detection agents will bind to PS on both the exterior and interior of the membrane. However, fluorescently labeled SapC-DOPS can be used with flow cytometry to distinguish only the externalized PS.

27160923|t|Of particular interest is the role of SapC-DOPS in detecting cancers that pose diagnostic challenges because of the tumor site or the intrinsic properties of the malignancy itself, by targeting surface PS of cancer cells and tumor vessels. Such cancers include glioblastoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, each of which carries a devastating prognosis despite years of diagnostic and therapeutic research.

27160923|t|Previous studies have taken in vitro data of fluorescently labeled SapC-DOPS a step further by evaluating diagnostic efficacy in vivo using mouse models. In one such study, mice bearing human neuroblastoma xenografts were injected intravenously with four different reagents: (1) SapC-DOPS conjugated to CVM, (2) unconjugated SapC and CVM, (3) DOPS and CVM, or (4) PBS alone [24]. The mice then underwent optical imaging at time intervals ranging from 0 to 48 h post-injection. The SapC-DOPS-CVM fluorescent signal was diffuse between 0 and 5 h, and had accumulated specifically within the tumor region by 24 h, persisting for up to 100 h. However, there was no fluorescence signal when uncoupled SapC was administered with DOPS-CVM [24]. Similar results were demonstrated by Kaimal et al. [29] in their mouse xenograft models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and neuroblastoma and a murine rhabdomyosarcoma model. These studies demonstrated the specificity of SapC-DOPS for cells that have undergone neoplastic transformation, with the consequent externalization of PS. As such, this is a new paradigm for improved diagnosis and early detection of malignancy.

27160923|t|In multi-angle rotational optical imaging (MAROI) to detect SapC-DOPS-CVM in mice [32], we used a rotational bed to obtain the in vivo image. Analysis of the MAROI signal curve provided multispectral and multimodal data derived from complete rotational coverage. We confirmed that optimal imaging depended on correct orientation during positioning; the fluorescence intensity decreased by as much as 9–12 % with each 10°of movement. Use of anatomical landmarks and concurrent X-ray imaging achieved both in vivo localization of the tumor and quantitation of fluorescent marker intensity. These findings can then be used in longitudinal studies to correlate fluorescent signal distribution directly with mapping of tumor location.

27160923|t|Comparison of non-invasive imaging procedures for cancer detection
27160923|a|

27160923|t|Among the factors considered when determining an optimal treatment plan for patients diagnosed with cancer, especially important are the size and location of the primary tumor and the extent of metastatic disease, if present. To define these characteristics and facilitate treatment, effective imaging modalities currently available include computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each modality can help define cancer staging and diagnosis, but can also be limited in its effectiveness, depending on the type and site of the cancer or the patient’s underlying medical conditions. When such limitations exist, invasive procedures or a combination of diverse imaging techniques may be needed to make a definitive diagnosis; this can be both time-consuming and cost prohibitive (see Table 1).
27160923|a|

27160923|t|CT has played a pivotal role in both diagnosis and staging of malignancy for several years. Although CT has been successful in upstaging many cancers at the time of diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes, several limitations prevent its universal applicability in cancer diagnosis, particularly in cases of local, microscopic disease spread. In a study of 957 lymph nodes evaluated from patients with head and neck cancers, Don et al. [33] found that 20 % of malignant lymph nodes had extracapsular spread; almost one third of these nodes were smaller than 10 mm, which is the size cut-off used to define pathological adenopathy on radiographic review. In addition, central necrosis, a common characteristic used to identify malignant lymph nodes by CT, were found primarily in lymph nodes that were 20 mm or larger, suggesting that central necrosis is a late event in metastatic adenopathy. Such findings suggest a deficiency in our ability to detect metastatic disease early in its course [33].
27160923|a|

27160923|t|In contrast with CT and MRI, detection by PET imaging has proven superior for regional nodal and distant metastases, but inferior for several primary malignancies [34]. Moreover, PET has very poor spatial resolution, limiting accurate biopsy because of poor localization of the potential malignancy. While this problem can be offset in part by combined PET-CT scanning, defects in registration between the signals can still pose problems with tumor localization [34].
27160923|a|

27160923|t|As such, currently available imaging modalities present shortcomings in our ability to detect occult spread of malignancy, which inevitably leads to delays in diagnosis of metastatic disease until it has spread more widely. At that point, few treatment options may remain. Such studies highlight the need for sensitive imaging techniques that focus on specifically revealing malignant cells, rather than probing tentative neoplastic properties of lymph nodes that may imply, but are not always specific for, malignancy.
27160923|a|

27160923|t|Detection of intracranial neoplasms, such as glioblastoma multiforme, also poses a diagnostic challenge by currently available imaging techniques. PET imaging, for example, relies on underlying tissue metabolism to detect malignancy, given that neoplastic cells have increased metabolic activity compared with normal tissue. Non-malignant brain tissue, however, has metabolic activity comparable to tumors found in areas outside of the brain. Because intracranial neoplasms cannot be accurately identified on PET imaging, a second mode of imaging is needed to detect either primary or metastatic disease in the brain. Similarly, a CT of the brain can delineate brain lesions but often cannot definitively distinguish neoplastic tumors from other causes of brain lesions, including infections or demyelinating diseases. Therefore, detection of intracranial malignancy currently relies on MRI for evaluation and characterization. Such studies, however, require prolonged acquisition time, which can cause increased motion artifact and result in poor image quality unless the patient is sedated, as for pediatric patients, which increases patient risk.
27160923|a|

27160923|t|Beyond accurate detection of malignancy, limitations in current imaging modalities also relate to any underlying medical conditions of the patient. For example, CT imaging often requires an intravenous contrast agent. Contrast can be particularly nephrotoxic for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease. This comorbidity is common in patients at the time of cancer diagnosis because of poor oral intake and prolonged cachexia, and can also be a frequent consequence of several chemotherapeutic regimens. Thus, contrast-enhanced CT imaging is commonly avoided in patients with underlying kidney disease. Similar caution must be taken when using gadolinium contrast for MRI in patients with kidney disease because of the possibility of adverse outcomes, such as nephrogenic systemic sclerosis, which carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Limitations in PET imaging occur in diabetic patients, because blood glucose levels can significantly impact tumor uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), the agent used to detect malignancy. In these cases, FDG and glucose compete for glucose transport and phosphorylation [35]. Guidelines currently require both tight glycemic control (i.e., glucose levels below 200 mg/dL) before PET imaging and that patients abstain from all glucose-containing food and drink for at least 6 h prior to the study. However, these restrictions have often proven difficult to achieve, thus compromising imaging quality and accuracy. Advances in combined PET/CT [36] and PET/MRI [37] have solved some of these problems. However, the toxicity of contrast agents and their inability to cross the blood–brain barrier limit their effectiveness and demonstrate the necessity for a diagnostic agent with limited side effects, few clinical restrictions, and enhanced specificity for neoplastic cells.

27160923|t|To improve MRI sensitivity, shorten scanning time, and improve safety, we have used SapC-DOPS as a carrier for contrast agents. The method of Bogdanov et al. [38] was implemented to encapsulate ferumoxtran-10, an ultra-small super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) contrast agent, into SapC-DOPS vesicles. The resulting SapC-DOPS-USPIO was used with MRI to detect tumors in mice [29]. The T2 relaxation time (i.e., time for the transverse magnetization to fall to approximately 37 % of its initial value after magnetization) of subcutaneous xenografts of neuroblastomas or pancreatic tumors was decreased by SapC-DOPS-USPIO, thus indicating the uptake of the agent by tumors. This allowed specific detection of the malignancy (Fig. 4a).

27160923|t|Additionally, we incorporated the paramagnetic contrast agent, gadolinium, into SapC-DOPS vesicles by using the lipophilic gadolinium chelate, gadolinium-DTPA-bis (stearylamide) [39]. These vesicles produced a 9 % increase in the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) of orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme tumors in mice within 10 h post-injection, but only minimal changes in normal brain tissue; again this demonstrated improved specificity of tumor detection.

27160923|t|We have recently used a phenol-substituted lipophilic dye to label SapC-DOPS with 124I, a positron emitter. We then used this labeled SapC-DOPS for PET imaging. As shown in Fig. 4b we were able to selectively enhance the intracranial glioblastomas with PET scanning [40]. Concurrent studies with SapC-DOPS labeled with 125I instead of 124I indicated that SapC-DOPS specifically targeted the tumor, although some label was detected in the liver and spleen, likely disposal routes.

27160923|t|These studies indicate the ability of SapC-DOPS to transverse the blood brain barrier without requiring either alteration of the barrier or direct intracranial administration of the agent [12]. This suggests a potential role for SapC-DOPS in improving the safety and convenience of detecting (and treating) intracranial neoplasms.

27160923|t|The pharmacologic safety of SapC-DOPS has been evaluated in mice at 12× the typical therapeutic dose of 4 mg/kg of Sap C and 2 mg/kg of DOPS [24]. Even at these levels, no acute toxicity or weight loss was demonstrated with administration. Furthermore, histological examination of vital organs (i.e., lung, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, brain) revealed neither damage nor toxic changes. Chronic toxicity studies were also performed with injection of 2× therapeutic concentrations of SapC-DOPS weekly for 5 weeks. Again, these studies demonstrated no significant toxicity on histological review of the vital organs listed above [24]. In comparison, the contrast agents currently used for image enhancement during CT and MRI scanning can place patients at risk for kidney damage or systemic disease. Beyond the pharmacologic safety evidence, we compared survival data for mice with pancreatic tumors treated with SapC-DOPS versus control groups. Mice treated with SapC-DOPS lived significantly longer compared with untreated control groups: specifically, all control mice had died by 23 weeks after treatment, while 4 of the 6 SapC-DOPS-treated mice were still alive [10]. Similar results were obtained with a brain tumor model [28]. Mice bearing orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme that were treated with DOPS alone all died within 20 days. However, 25 % of those treated with SapC-DOPS survived at least 350 days. In addition, the tumors were smaller in the SapC-DOPS treated mice. Again, these studies provide pre-clinical data to support the safety of systemic SapC-DOPS administration for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Although there is some therapeutic value of SapC-DOPS with the dose that would be injected for diagnostic purposes, multiple doses are generally given to shrink tumors. Additionally, as SapC-DOPS is a nanovesicle it can be loaded with radioisotopes or chemotherapeutic drugs to provide further benefit.

27160923|t|Conclusions
27160923|a|

27160923|t|Our data indicate that the novel and PS-targeted nanovesicle, SapC-DOPS, can be used for exposure of hard to detect malignancies, whether due to size or location. Although further studies are required, our preclinical studies suggest that the tumor–selective nanovesicles may greatly contribute to improving the precision of early cancer diagnosis. In addition, SapC-DOPS may have a therapeutic benefit and be used as a “theranostic” compound. Ongoing studies are to provide support for the inclusion of SapC-DOPS in the battery of tests conducted by oncologists to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of tumor diagnosis.

27128906|t|Glutathione in its reduced form (GSH) is an antioxidant and also is involved in pheomelanin formation. Thus, it has been long believed that GSH has a skin whitening effect. However, its actual or direct effect is unproven. We evaluated the anti-melanogenic effects of GSH and its derivatives in vitro. We examined change of melanogenesis and its related proteins by GSH itself and its derivatives, including GSH monoethyl ester (GSH-MEE), GSH diethyl ester (GSH-DEE) and GSH monoisopropyl ester (GSH-MIPE) in Melan-A cells, Mel-Ab cells, and B16F10 cells. GSH and GSH-MEE did not display cytotoxic activity, but GSH-MIPE and GSH-DEE did. Intriguingly, GSH itself had no inhibitory effect on melanin production or intracellular tyrosinase activity. Rather, it was GSH-MEE and GSH-MIPE that profoundly reduced the amount of melanin and intracellular tyrosinase activity. Thus, GSH-MEE was selected as a suitable candidate skin-whitening agent and it did not alter melanogenesis-associated proteins such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2, but it did increase the amount of suggested pheomelanin and suggested pheomelanin/eumelanin ratio. GSH-MEE was effective for anti-melanogenesis, whereas GSH itself was not. GSH-MEE could be developed as a safe and efficient agent for the treatment of hyperpigmentation skin disorders.

27128906|t|1. Introduction
27128906|a|

27128906|t|Melasma and other skin hyperpigmentation disorders are often difficult to treat and often require multimodal approaches, including anti-melanogenesis (mostly anti-tyrosinase) and antioxidant strategies. Glutathione has long been considered and even used as an intravenous product for skin whitening and for the treatment of melasma, but its real or direct effect remains unproven. Because melasma is often refractory to various treatments, an anti-melasma oral formulation composed of cysteine (a component of GSH), Vitamin C, and tranexamic acid is also popular. A report [1] involving a small number of subjects in Thailand, and short-term follow up, showed that oral administration of glutathione resulted in lightening of skin color.

27128906|t|The skin is purposefully placed at the interface with the external environment where it has been developed to detect, incorporate and respond to various stressors including ultraviolet (UV) radiation [2]. Within the role of the skin as a stress organ, melanogenesis acts as a molecular sensor and transducer of noxious stimuli and as controller of local homeostasis [3]. l-tyrosine and l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) not only serve as substrates and intermediates of melanogenesis, but are also known to be modulatory agents acting as inducers and positive regulators of melanogenesis as well as regulators of other cellular functions [4]. Although the primary function of melanin pigment and melanogenic apparatus is to protect the normal melanocytes from UV radiation and oxidative stress, at times, melanin can affect melanoma’s progression [5]. Melanogenesis is mostly affected by the activity of tyrosinase. The melanin pigment is produced from l-tyrosine that is converted to dopaquinone by the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase. This reaction proceeds spontaneously via dopachrome to the monomeric indolic precursors of eumelanin. Upon reaction with cysteine, dopaquinone forms 2- or 5-S-cysteinyldopa that produces benzothiazine precursors of pheomelanin polymer [3,6].

27128906|t|Glutathione, a tripeptide component of cysteine, glutamate and glycine, is a key antioxidant in the body and serves crucial roles in maintaining intracellular thiol status, and in detoxification of electrophilic metabolites as well as in xenobiotics. Although glutathione is present in its both reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) states, the majority of it found in the body is in the reduced form. GSH conducts antioxidant activity by scavenging free-radicals during reductive detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxide [7]. In addition to its antioxidant effect by removing free radicals and peroxides that assist tyrosinase activation and melanin production, GSH is known to be essential for pheomelanin formation because it mediates the mechanism for switching from eumelanin to pheomelanin production, which may provide another powerful strategy for skin whitening. Another proposed mechanism of GSH action involves the direct suppression of the tyrosinase activity when GSH binds to the copper-containing active site of tyrosinase [8].

27128906|t|Although intra-melanocytic GSH has been known to affect the regulation of melanogenesis, the effect of exogenous GSH is unclear. It is generally believed that GSH itself is not transported across the cell membrane. Moreover, the presence of GSH carriers for melanosomal transport has not been reported, nor does it seem likely that simple diffusion or a membrane channel could enable GSH entry into melanosomes.

27128906|t|Therefore, we hypothesized that the ester forms of GSH derivatives could have de-pigmenting efficacy superior to GSH, because the ester form of GSH derivatives could be delivered to intracellular spaces. In this study, we examined the anti-melanogenic efficacy of GSH and its derivatives, and sought to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms.

27128906|t|GSH and GSH-MEE (Figure 1a) did not affect cellular viability in Melan-A cells (Figure 1b). GSH monoisopropyl ester (GSH-MIPE) had slight cellular toxicity (80% cell viability of control at 8 mM, Figure 1b) and GSH diethyl ester (GSH-DEE) had a profound cellular toxicity in Melan-A cells, even at concentrations as low as 2 mM (Figure 1b). For this reason, GSH-DEE was not used in subsequent experiments.

27128906|t|We then determined the effect of GSH, GSH-MEE, and GSH-MIPE on melanogenesis. Surprisingly, GSH had no inhibitory effect on melanogenesis: the melanin content did not change at any concentration tested (Figure 2a,b). However, GSH-MEE and GSH-MIPE decreased melanin production in Melan-A cells (Figure 2a). The decrease of melanin content by GSH-MEE was reproduced in another melanocyte-derived cell line, Mel-Ab (Figure 2c). We next examined the effects of GSH, GSH-MEE, and GSH-MIPE on tyrosinase activity. In Melan-A cells, as expected, GSH did not affect intracellular activity of tyrosinase, but GSH-MEE and GSH-MIPE inhibited the activity of intracellular tyrosinase (Figure 2d). Although both GSH-MEE and GSH-MIPE showed evident antimelanogenic effects, GSH-MEE was considered a more promising candidate de-pigmenting agent because it did not compromise cellular viability.

27128906|t|Therefore, further experiments were focused on GSH-MEE. To evalute how the concentration of GSH-MEE affects melanongenesis, cells were treated with 2–8 mM GSH-MEE. Two days after, the melanin content was measured. The results revealed the negative regulatory effect of GSH-MEE on melanin synthesis in both Melan-A cells and B16F10 cells (Figure 3a,b). The intracellular tyrosinase activity was also suppressed in both cells (Figure 3c,d), and the responses of melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity to various doses of GSH-MEE were in accordance with each other. However, GSH-MEE did not reduce the protein levels of tyrosinase, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 significantly at the test-doses above (Figure 3d). These data suggest that GSH-MEE regulates intracellular activity of tyrosinase and subsequently downregulates melanin synthesis.

27128906|t|Finally, we sought to determine whether the GSH-MEE-mediated decrease in melanin synthesis results from its regulation of suggested pheomelanin and eumelanin production. Melan-A cells were incubated with GSH-MEE for 48 h, and then the suggested eumelanin and pheomelanin content was measured using spectrophotometric analysis. GSH-MEE increased the melanin with A400 production and decreased the melanin with A350. (Figure 3e). The A350 values are referred to as spectrophotometric eumelanin and the A400 values are referred to as spectrophotometric pheomelanin. Taken together, these results indicate that GSH-MEE may have a de-pigmenting effect by inhibiting tyrosinase activity, resulting in reduction of suggested eumelanin synthesis and increase of suggested pheomelanin synthesis.

27128906|t|3. Discussion
27128906|a|

27128906|t|The majority of glutathione is present in its reduced form, GSH, which is a well-known antioxidant. Accordingly, GSH is expected to repress melanin production by redox mechanisms. Exhaustion of GSH in the skin by UV radiation might induce the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as a result of insufficient detoxification. Subsequently, increased melanin synthesis could be further promoted by hydrogen peroxide or other reactive oxygen species [9,10,11]. On the other hand, for more than 30 years, GSH has been known to be a regulatory molecule in mammalian melanogenesis, that is, an endogenous reductant diverting dopaquinone to pheomelanin pathway ultimately leading to skin whitening. In addition, it was proposed that GSH affects melanogenesis by inhibiting tyrosinase activity [12,13,14,15]. Tyrosinase plays the main enzymatic role in melanogenesis, catalyzing the conversion of l-tyrosine into l-dopaquinone. It was reported thiol groups directly inhibit tyrosinase by acting on copper at the active site of the enzyme [16]. For this reason, the skin whitening effect of exogenous GSH has been assumed for long, even though the effect of an intravenous product for the treatment of melasma and other hyperpigmentary disorders was unclear and unproven. Thus, the data regarding the effect of GSH on pigmentation is inconclusive [1].

27128906|t|Also, if GSH had a direct regulatory effect on melanogenesis, at the least, it would be required that GSH be transported into melanosomes. Carrier-mediated lysosomal membrane transport systems remain for cysteine [17]. However, GSH is not transported into melanosomes, nor is GSH likely to be capable of enter melanosomes by simple diffusion or through a membrane channel. (Figure 4) [18].

27128906|t|Therefore, we hypothesized that the ester form of a GSH derivative would be more effective at entering melanosomes because the GSH ester form is more lipophilic (Figure 4). In our study, we determined the effects of GSH and GSH derivatives on melanin synthesis, and evaluated the cellular mechanism of the regulation of melanogenesis in vitro.

27128906|t|Intriguingly, we found that GSH did neither suppress the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase, nor reduce melanin synthesis. However, its derivatives, GSH-MEE and GSH-MIPE did reduce melanin synthesis. These findings are consistent with our null hypothesis that the esterified derivatives of GSH would show superior efficacy because of the feasibility of intracellular and intra-melanosomal delivery [19,20]. In our study, among the esterified derivatives of GSH, the most suitable candidate whitening agent was GSH-MEE. Furthermore, GSH-MEE has a lipophilic nature that makes it better able to penetrate skin as a topical agent.

27128906|t|GSH-MEE demonstrated itself to be an effective compound for inhibiting cellular melanin synthesis, and was also not cytotoxic, unlike the other esterified derivatives of GSH, GSH-MIPE and GSH-DEE. We further evaluated the regulation mechanism of the anti-melanogenic effect caused by GSH-MEE. It did not significantly decrease the levels of melanogenesis-associated proteins such as MITF, tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2, but it increased the amount of suggested pheomelanin and the ratio of suggested pheomelanin/eumelanin. The biosynthesis of melanin takes place through a complex but orderly sequence of enzymatic and chemical reactions. The melanins produced are conventionally classified into two major types: eumelanins (brown or black) and sulfur-containing pheomelanins (red or yellow) [21]. Within the melanocytes, sulfhydryl compounds such as GSH and its precursor cysteine, are actively involved in the melanogenic process of making pheomelanin [6]. Besides their essential roles in pigmentation, the intracellular concentrations of GSH and cysteine are also a crucial regulator of the switch of eumelanin to pheomelanin [22]. Decreased tyrosinase activity is also associated with a more marked shift to pheomelanin synthesis, as it is considered to be the default pathway [23].

27128906|t|A recent study showed anti-melanogenic effects of exogenous GSH in melanoma cells [24]. We speculated that the discrepancy might be related with the extracellular metabolism of GSH. γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), an ectoenzyme involved in the degradation of GSH derivatives exported from cytosol cleaves the γ-glutamyl peptide bond of GSH to generate cysteinylglycine and transfers the γ-glutamyl group to another amino acid including cysteine [20].

27128906|t|The first limitation of this study to be addressed was using the spectrophotometric analysis to measure concentrations of eumelanin and pheomelanin. The measurement of degraded products by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or the noninvasive method of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) are more analytical methods to measure concentrations of eumelanin and pheomelanin than the spectrophotometric analysis used in this study [25,26]. The second limitation of this study was the strict focus on mouse melanocytes lines and inconsistent use of cell lines. Therefore, further studies to determine the anti-melanogenic effect of GSH-MEE on other mouse melanocytes and human melanocytes will be needed.

Briefly, Melan-A cells were treated with each of the GSH and its derivatives in culture medium containing PMA (200 nM) for 48 h. B16F10 cells were incubated at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 6-well plates overnight. α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH, 200 nM) was then added and cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the GSH and its derivatives in phenol red-free DMEM for 3 days. Cells were re-suspended in 600 µL of 1 g/L NaOH at 100 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The optical densities (OD) of the supernatants were measured using an ELISA reader at 405 nm. The melanin content was calculated by normalizing the melanin content to total cellular protein content, as measured by a Micro BCA assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).

27128906|t|In separate experiments, contents of eumelanin and pheomelanin candidates were measured using spectrophotometric assay methods specific for the respective melanin type [29,30,31]. For the spectrophotometric measurement of eumelanin, 2.4 × 107 cells were heated for 20 h at 130 °C in 500 µL hydriodic acid with 30 µL H2O2, and insoluble eumelanin was solubilized by heating for 30 min at 100 °C in 1 mol·L−1 NaOH in the existence of H2O2, and analysed for A350 [30]. The A350 values are suggested as eumelanin. For the spectrophotometric assay of pheomelanin, 1.6 × 107 cells were isolated with 0.1 mol·L−1 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 10.5. Supernatants were analyzed for A400. These values are suggested as pheomelanin.

27128906|a|

27128906|t|In our study, esterified GSH derivative, particularly GSH-MEE (but not GSH itself), was effective without affecting cellular viability for reducing melanin and tyrosinase activity and raising the suggested pheomelanin/eumelanin ratio. Taken together, this novel esterified GSH derivative could be developed as a safe and efficient agent for the treatment of hyperpigmentary skin disorders.

26857916|t|Summary
26857916|a|

26857916|t|Drought stress has adverse impacts on plant production and productivity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one class of noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression post‐transcriptionally. In this study, we employed small RNA and degradome sequencing to systematically investigate the tissue‐specific miRNAs responsible to drought stress, which are understudied in tomato. For this purpose, root and upground tissues of two different drought‐responsive tomato genotypes (Lycopersicon esculentum as sensitive and L. esculentum var. cerasiforme as tolerant) were subjected to stress with 5% polyethylene glycol for 7 days. A total of 699 conserved miRNAs belonging to 578 families were determined and 688 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between different treatments, tissues and genotypes. Using degradome sequencing, 44 target genes were identified associated with 36 miRNA families. Drought‐related miRNAs and their targets were enriched functionally by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Totally, 53 miRNAs targeted 23 key drought stress‐ and tissue development‐related genes, including DRP (dehydration‐responsive protein), GTs (glycosyltransferases), ERF (ethylene responsive factor), PSII (photosystem II) protein, HD‐ZIP (homeodomain‐leucine zipper), MYB and NAC‐domain transcription factors. miR160, miR165, miR166, miR171, miR398, miR408, miR827, miR9472, miR9476 and miR9552 were the key miRNAs functioning in regulation of these genes and involving in tomato response to drought stress. Additionally, plant hormone signal transduction pathway genes were differentially regulated by miR169, miR172, miR393, miR5641, miR5658 and miR7997 in both tissues of both sensitive and tolerant genotypes. These results provide new insight into the regulatory role of miRNAs in drought response with plant hormone signal transduction and drought‐tolerant tomato breeding.

26857916|t|Introduction
26857916|a|

26857916|t|Drought is one of the destructive environmental stress condition that restricts crop production and reproduction in plants (Ding et al., 2013). Plants cope with drought stress by recruiting drought avoidance and/or drought tolerance mechanisms at the morphological, physiological, biochemical, cellular and molecular levels such as decreased stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and respiration alterations, production of antioxidant and scavenger compounds, osmotic re‐adjustment and hormonal metabolism changes (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005; Bhargava and Sawant, 2013; Ding et al., 2013; Fang and Xiong, 2015). All of these strategies cause gene expression induction and accumulation of some enzymes and drought‐related proteins (Ding et al., 2013; Ramachandra Reddy et al., 2004; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi‐Shinozaki, 2007). Control of gene expression is one of the regulatory mechanisms on plant response to drought (Golldack et al., 2011). Epigenetic regulations such as methylation, histone modifications and post‐transcriptional alterations are stress‐inducible mechanisms and have important roles in stress tolerance (Bhargava and Sawant, 2013).
26857916|a|

26857916|t|In plants, small RNA‐mediated regulatory mechanisms play crucial roles on biological processes including growth, development, maturation, transposon silencing, response to abiotic stress and pathogen defence (Xie et al., 2012; Li and Zhang, 2016). Small RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate abiotic stress‐related gene expression post‐transcriptionally, down‐regulating their target genes, while their expression changes conversely (Carrington and Ambros, 2003; Ding et al., 2013; Sunkar, 2010; Zhang, 2015; Zhang and Wang, 2015). Many miRNAs response to drought stress via signal transduction pathways such as auxin signalling, ABA‐mediated regulation, osmoprotectant biosynthesis and scavenging of antioxidants (Ding et al., 2013). Drought‐related miRNAs and their targets have been identified in different plants such as Arabidopsis (Liu et al., 2008; Sunkar and Zhu, 2004), cotton (Xie et al., 2015), switchgrass (Xie et al., 2014) rice (Zhao et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2010) and soya bean (Kulcheski et al., 2011). However, no systematical study has been performed on tomato.

26857916|t|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is an economically important crop due to demand for fresh vegetable market and processed food industry worldwide (Klee and Giovannoni, 2011). Tomato contains strong antioxidant enzymes, high level of lycopene, rich iron content, and vitamins A and C (Rai et al., 2013). Tomato is also one of the most favoured models for fleshly fruit ripening and epigenetic researches (Gonzalez et al., 2013; Klee and Giovannoni, 2011). Tomato growth, productivity and nutritional quality are generally affected by environmental stress factors such as drought, salt, flooding and pathogen infection (Rai et al., 2013). Cultivated tomatoes (L. esculentum) are known as sensitive to drought at all stages of plant development, while seed germination and early seedling stages are mostly affected (Foolad et al., 2003). However, their wild types such as L. pimpinellifolium, L. pennellii,L. chilense and L. esculentum var. cerasiforme are drought‐tolerant species (Sadashiva et al., 2013). Researches are in progress to clarify molecular pathways on drought response of plants (Sadashiva et al., 2013), and miRNAs can be alternatives to identify drought metabolism, as they play crucial role on abiotic stress response regulating the stress‐related mRNAs (Kumar, 2014). Determination and functional characterization of stress‐related miRNAs and target identification are important in breeding programmes and can contribute to developing new strategies for improving stress tolerance (Barrera‐Figueroa et al., 2013). Although several studies have been performed on tomato miRNAs (Cao et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2014; Karlova et al., 2013; Korir et al., 2013; Moxon et al., 2008; Pilcher et al., 2007), there is no study on genomewide drought‐responsive miRNA identification of tomato in tissue‐specific manner.

26857916|t|In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs and determine their expressions in different tissues under drought stress. For this purpose, we sequenced both root and upground tissues of drought‐sensitive (L. esculentum) and drought‐tolerant (L. esculentum var. cerasiforme) tomato genotypes. Also we carried out degradome sequencing for identifying the targets of drought‐related miRNAs. From here, we identified a total of 699 conserved miRNAs belonging to 578 families, in which 688 miRNAs were differentially expressed between different treatments, tissues and genotypes. We also identified 44 target genes associated with 36 miRNA families. These miRNAs and their targets play an important role in tomato response to drought stress.

26857916|t|Data mining of small RNA sequencing
26857916|a|

26857916|t|To reveal tissue‐specific and tolerance‐related miRNAs under drought conditions, eight small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced. These samples included four drought‐treated (D) and four untreated (C) samples, in which each contained two roots (R) and two upgrounds (U) tissues belonging to drought‐sensitive L. esculentum (S) and drought‐tolerant L. esculentum var. cerasiforme (T) genotypes. After sequencing, a total of 194 625 986 raw and 192 387 328 clean reads were obtained with the average of 24 328 248 and 24 048 416 (98.85%) reads in each library, respectively (Table S1). The clean tags were used for analysing the distribution of 16‐ to 28‐nt‐length small RNAs and 94.78% of them were determined among 20–24 nt, while the most abundant sRNAs were 21 and 24 nt lengths with the percentage of 21.75% and 35.60%, respectively (Figure 1). However, the small RNA distributions of two libraries (Sensitive C‐R and Sensitive D‐R) were a little different from common results, in which 20‐nt small RNAs are also dominant except 21‐nt and 24‐nt small RNAs. This has not been reported in other plant species. However, the reason for this is unclear; 20‐nt small RNAs may have some role in this situation. About 70.29% and 69.10% unique and 83.72% and 83.01% redundant reads were mapped to tomato genome database (ITAG Release 2.4) in root and upground libraries, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Using the blastn and blastall alignments against Genbank and Rfam databases, small RNAs were annotated to root and upground tissues of tomato genotypes which have different response to drought stress. In root libraries, most abundant RNA class was rRNA for unique reads with the mean value of 2.32%, followed by tRNA (0.23%), snRNA (0.13%) and snoRNA (0.12%). As for redundant reads, tRNAs were most abundant (21.41%) and other RNAs had quantity with the average of 10.47% (rRNA), 0.23% (snRNA) and 0.17% (snoRNA) (Table 1). For upground libraries, the annotation results were similar and rRNA proportion was highest (1.26%) in unique reads followed by tRNA (0.13%), snRNA (0.06%) and snoRNA (0.04%). In redundant reads, tRNA amount was 10.78% with the highest value, followed by rRNA (3.65%), snRNA (0.05%) and snoRNA (0.03%) (Table 2).

26857916|t|Identification of miRNAs from deep sequencing
26857916|a|

26857916|t|To identify miRNAs, the clean sequence tags were aligned to all plant miRNA mature sequences deposited in miRBase database (Kozomara and Griffiths‐Jones, 2014). The average of 44 046 (0.72%) and 44 780 (0.69%) unique, and 2 157 079 (8.94%) and 4 609 840 (19.19%) redundant reads were matched to the currently known miRNA sequences for root and upground libraries, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Totally, 699 miRNAs were obtained from sequencing in eight libraries which belong to 578 families (Table S2). Among 578 families, sly‐miR171 was represented with seven members, as the largest one, followed by sly‐miR166 and sly‐miR319 with five members (Table S2). Eleven miRNA families (sly‐miR156, sly‐miR157, sly‐miR164, sly‐miR166, sly‐miR167, sly‐miR168, sly‐miR4414, sly‐miR6022, sly‐miR6027, sly‐miR7822 and sly‐miR9471) were represented with the top read abundance above 10 000 at all libraries (Table S2).
26857916|a|

26857916|t|We evaluated the miRNA distribution among libraries and determined that 197 miRNAs were common among control and drought‐treated samples of both sensitive and tolerant genotypes in root libraries (Figure 2a). When we compared the genotypes separately, 35 miRNAs were common between control and drought samples of sensitive genotype and 32 miRNAs such as sly‐miR166k, sly‐miR408‐3p and sly‐miR9552b‐3p were specific to control plants, whereas 25 miRNAs such as sly‐miR1101‐3p, sly‐miR2628 and sly‐miR3932b‐3p were expressed only in drought‐treated roots of sensitive genotype (Table S2). In tolerant genotype, 32 miRNAs such as sly‐miR165b‐5p, sly‐miR2867‐3p and sly‐miR7520 were expressed only in control conditions, while 74 miRNAs such as sly‐miR171f‐5p, sly‐mir838‐5p and sly‐miR8046‐3p were expressed specifically after drought exposure (Table S2). Additionally, 85 miRNAs were commonly expressed between control and drought treatments in tolerant genotype (Figure 2a). In upground samples, 222 miRNAs were common among four samples. Additionally, in control and drought‐treated samples, 37 miRNAs such as sly‐miR171a‐3p, sly‐miR6024‐3p and sly‐miR7997a were expressed specifically in control conditions, while 44 miRNAs such as sly‐miR845a, sly‐miR5797 and sly‐miR8762d were specific to drought‐treated upground tissues in sensitive genotype (Table S2, Figure 2b). In terms of tolerant genotype, 47 miRNAs such as sly‐miR166d‐5p, sly‐miR4392 and sly‐miR6288a showed specific expression in control sample, whereas 28 miRNAs such as sly‐miR904a, sly‐miR5171a and sly‐miR6485 were expressed specifically in response to dehydration stress (Table S2, Figure 2b). Furthermore, sensitive control and drought libraries shared 48 miRNAs, while tolerant control and drought libraries had 50 common miRNAs (Figure 2b). When we compared eight libraries consisting of 699 miRNAs, we determined 165 miRNAs to be expressed commonly in all samples, while 63 and 90 miRNAs were expressed only in sensitive (C‐R, 16; D‐R, 14; C‐U, 24; D‐U, 19) and tolerant genotypes (C‐R, 11; D‐R, 39; C‐U, 27; D‐U, 13), respectively (Figure 2c).

26857916|t|Expression analyses of miRNAs
26857916|a|

26857916|t|A total of 688 of 699 (98.4%) miRNAs belonging to eight libraries were expressed significantly based on fold change (≥1 or ≤−1) and P/q‐value (<0.05) criteria (Table S2) and at least 130 miRNAs expressed approximately in all tomato libraries (Figure 3). Some miRNAs expressed differentially in root and upground tissues of sensitive and tolerant genotypes under control and drought conditions. Generally, the majority of miRNAs were down‐regulated in sensitive genotype (mostly in upgrounds), while up‐regulated in tolerant genotype (mostly in roots) by drought stress treatment (Table S2). A total of 11 miRNAs showed significant expression in all tissues of two genotypes in response to drought stress (Figure 4a, Table S2). For example, the expression of sly‐miR169a‐5p was decreased in all tissues, even the decrease was higher in root tissues. However, the expression of sly‐miR6261 was decreased in root and upground tissues in sensitive genotype, whereas increased in tolerant genotype. In root, specific expression changes were observed. Some miRNAs were down‐regulated in sensitive genotype, while up‐regulated in tolerant by drought exposure; these miRNAs include sly‐miR403‐3p and sly‐miR845a‐3p. Contrary to this, sly‐miR5512a and sly‐miR9559‐5p were up‐regulated in sensitive genotype, but down‐regulated in tolerant genotype. Additionally, the expression patterns were similar for certain miRNAs in both sensitive and tolerant genotypes. For instance, sly‐miR399a‐5p and sly‐miR5282 were down‐regulated with drought, while sly‐miR4346 and sly‐miR6269 were up‐regulated in root tissues of two genotypes (Figure 4b, Table S2). Similarly, same expression alteration patterns were observed in upground tissues. For example, the expressions of sly‐miR7494b and sly‐miR7997c were increased, whereas sly‐miR5029 were decreased in two genotypes. In addition, some adverse alterations were observed in two genotypes. Sly‐miR479 and sly‐miR837‐3p were down‐regulated, but up‐regulated in sensitive and tolerant genotypes, respectively; sly‐miR3954 and sly‐miR9471a‐5p were up‐regulated, but down‐regulated in sensitive and tolerant genotypes, respectively (Figure 4c, Table S2). Some miRNAs showed tissue‐ and genotype‐specific expression patterns. For example, several miRNAs were expressed only in root tissues in sensitive genotype and repressed/downregulated by drought exposure such as sly‐miR166k, sly‐miR408‐3p and sly‐miR9552b‐3p (Table S2). Similarly, some miRNAs showed expression only in upground tissues of sensitive genotype and the expression level was decreased or repressed after drought stress such as sly‐miR171a‐3p, sly‐miR1426, sly‐miR5239, sly‐miR6024‐3p and sly‐miR7997a (Table S2). In tolerant genotype, the expression of some miRNAs (sly‐miR2867‐3p, sly‐miR3514‐5p, sly‐miR5251, sly‐miR5763, sly‐miR7520, sly‐miR7730‐5p, sly‐mi8751b and sly‐miR9493) was also specific to root tissues and suppressed/decreased by dehydration (Table S2). Likewise, some miRNAs were expressed specifically in drought‐tolerant upground tissues and down‐regulated or repressed with drought treatment such as sly‐miR166d‐5p, sly‐miR408a‐3p, sly‐miR1507c‐5p, sly‐miR1857‐5p, sly‐miR4392, sly‐miR6288a and sly‐miR9722 (Table S2). Certain miRNAs were induced/upregulated by drought treatment in all tissues and genotypes. Among them, sly‐miR319a, sly‐miR1101a‐3p, sly‐miR2628 and sly‐miR3932b‐5p were specific to sensitive root tissues; sly‐miR845a, sly‐miR1511‐3p, sly‐miR5259, sly‐miR5797 and sly‐miR6440b to sensitive upground tissues; sly‐miR171f‐5p, sly‐miR838‐5p, sly‐miR946a‐5p, sly‐miR1846a‐5p, sly‐miR3637‐3p, sly‐miR5035‐3p, sly‐miR5760 and sly‐miR6172 to tolerant root; and sly‐miR904a, sly‐miR5171a, sly‐miR6173, sly‐miR6225‐3p and sly‐miR6485 to tolerant upground tissues (Table S2). When we evaluated the drought‐sensitive and tolerant genotypes, we determined that a total of 20 miRNAs were expressed in all four libraries belonging to sensitive genotype such as sly‐miR529 g and sly‐miR5817 (Figure 5a, Table S2). Similarly, 28 miRNAs showed expression only in all tolerant‐related libraries such as sly‐miR415, sly‐miR1520 g and sly‐miR2111 (Figure 5b, Table S2).

26857916|a|

26857916|t|psRNATarget server (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/) was used to predict miRNA target transcripts; a total of 41 300 miRNA target pairs were obtained which contain 688 significantly expressed miRNAs (Table S3). These targets were mainly transcription factors, stress‐ and dehydration‐/drought‐related proteins, resistance‐associated proteins and significant cellular enzymes like kinases, transferases and phosphatases (Table S3). Among these, 360 miRNAs (such as sly‐miR319‐3p, sly‐miR2089‐3p and sly‐miR5671a) targeted plant development and stress response‐related transcription factors, such as MYB, WRKY, GRAS, TCP, NAC‐domain, ARF (auxin response factor), SBP (squamosa promoter‐binding‐protein‐like), LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) protein and ERF (ethylene responsive factor) families (Table S3). Additionally, stress‐related proteins known as stress‐responsive protein, stress‐enhanced protein, universal stress protein and stress‐induced protein were potentially targeted by 49 miRNAs, such as sly‐miR164a, sly‐miR1074, sly‐miR1873, sly‐miR2628 and sly‐miR5029. Also, especially some miRNA target genes were associated with dehydration/drought stress directly. These transcripts included dehydration‐responsive family protein, DRP (dehydration‐responsive protein), ERD (early responsive to dehydration‐like) protein, DREB (dehydration‐responsive element binding) and Di19 protein (dehydration‐/drought‐induced 19 protein) and potentially regulated by 38 tomato miRNAs; these miRNAs included sly‐miR160a‐3p, sly‐miR170‐3p, sly‐miR1074, sly‐miR3948, sly‐miR5081, sly‐miR5758, sly‐miR8001b‐5p and sly‐miR9748.

26857916|t|We employed degradome sequencing to identify miRNA targets. After sequencing, a total of 10 819 148 raw and 10 799 028 clean tags (99.81%) were obtained. Then, the clean tags were mapped to the reference genome database of tomato ITAG 2.4 Release (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/genomes/Solanum_lycopersicum/annotation/ITAG2.4_release/ITAG2.4 genomic.fasta) by SOAP2.20 (Li et al., 2009) and 7 422 369 matched tags (68.73%) were determined. With the classification of these tags, cDNA_sense tags were selected and the identified 1 249 158 (46.86%) unique 5′ cDNA tags were used for the prediction of cleavage sites of tomato miRNAs. After prediction using CleaveLand v3.0.1 pipeline (Addo‐Quaye et al., 2009), a total of 59 cleavage sites were determined associated with 62 miRNAs and 44 target genes and 115 specific miRNA–mRNA pairs were predicted at cleavage sites with P‐value <0.05 (Table S4). For the identification of cleavage sites, degradome peaks are classified into five categories according to the peak height at mRNA position and the targets with category 0 or 1 were evaluated as the most significant (Karlova et al., 2013). In tomato degradome results, 15 target genes were related to stimulus response such as ARF and disease resistance proteins were identified in category 0 cleaved by sly‐miR160, sly‐miR168, sly‐miR172, sly‐miR396, sly‐miR482, sly‐miR6023 and sly‐miR6024 families (Figure 6, Table S4). In category 1, only two genes cleaved by miR156 and miR162 families were obtained (Table S4). In another significant class of peaks, category 2, mostly stimulus‐ and cellular component organization‐associated 47 mRNAs like PSII (photosystem II) protein, NAD(H) kinase, phosphorus transporter, ATP‐sulfurylase and SCL (scarecrow‐like) protein were determined. These targets were cleaved by sly‐miR156, sly‐miR164, sly‐miR166, sly‐miR169, sly‐miR171, sly‐miR395 and sly‐mir9477 (Table S4). The rest of 51 target genes were belonged to less significant categories 3 and 4. One of the stimulus response‐associated target PSII degraded by 16 miRNA families such as sly‐miR167, sly‐miR319, sly‐miR390, sly‐miR482, sly‐mir1919, sly‐miR5302 and sly‐miR9479. Other two stress‐related genes, SBP and ARF, were cleaved by sly‐miR156 and sly‐miR160 families, respectively. Sly‐miR171, sly‐miR403 and sly‐miR6027 families targeted histone‐arginine methyltransferase involved in cellular and developmental process, and sly‐miR395 and sly‐miR9477 degraded acyltransferase gene, the cellular and metabolic process‐associated target (Table S4).

26857916|a|

26857916|t|Gene ontology (GO)‐based enrichment analysis was performed to further investigate the potential role of miRNAs in tomato response to drought stress. A total of 9810 potential miRNA targets were classified into 665 biological processes, 45 molecular functions and 72 cellular components (Table S5). Some of the significant biological processes with the highest target numbers were cellular process (GO:0009987), cellular metabolic process (GO:0044237), response to stimulus (GO:0050896), response to abiotic stimulus (GO:0009628), response to stress (GO:0006950) and response to water deprivation (GO:0009414) (Table S5). Binding (GO:0005488), catalytic activity (GO:0003824), nucleotide binding (0000166) and hydrolase activity (0016787) were among the most abundant classes in molecular function category (Table S5). The common cellular component terms were cell part (GO:0044464), intracellular part (GO:0044424), organelle part (GO:0043226) and cytoplasmic part (GO:0044444) (Table S5). We employed agriGO web‐based tool to visualize the enriched biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories and draw hierarchical graphs of significantly enriched GO terms (Du et al., 2010). In biological process, stress‐associated terms such as response to hormone stimulus (GO:0009725) like abscisic acid (GO:0009737), jasmonic acid (GO:0009753), auxin (GO:0009733), ethylene (GO:0009723) and salicylic acid (GO:0009751), response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0000302), response to water deprivation (GO:0009414), response to salt stress (GO:0009651) and signal transduction (GO:0007165) were related to each other (Figures 7a and 8) and development‐related ontologies like fruit development (GO:0010154), shoot development (GO:0048367), seed development (GO:004831), root development (GO:0048364) and leaf development (GO:0048366) were determined (Figure 8). Pyrophosphatase activity (GO:0016452), nucleoside‐triphosphatase activity (GO:0017111), ATPase activity (GO: 0016887), purine ribonucleotide binding (GO: 003255) and ATP binding (GO:0005524) were some of the significantly enriched molecular function terms (Figure 7b, Table S5). In cellular component category, organelle subcompartment (GO:0031984), cell junction (GO:0030054), vacuole (GO:0031984) and chloroplast thylakoid (GO:0009534) were categorized significantly (Figure 7c, Table S5).

26857916|a|

26857916|t|KEGG (The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome) annotation was carried out for pathway analysis, and 289 KEGG pathways were obtained. Thirty‐six pathways including 2414 genes were detected as closely associated with drought stress including plant–pathogen interaction, biosynthesis of plant hormones, plant hormone signal transduction, oxidative phosphorylation, calcium signalling pathway, carotenoid metabolism, alpha‐Linolenic acid metabolism, brassinosteroid biosynthesis and photosynthesis (Figure 9). Plant hormone signal transduction pathway was represented by 134 genes and contained auxin‐, cytokinine‐, gibberellin‐, abscisic acid‐, ethylene‐, brassinosteroid‐, jasmonic acid‐ and salicylic acid‐associated signalling genes inducible via abiotic and biotic stresses (Figure 10). For example, carotenoid biosynthesis was involved in the pathway, contributes to abscisic acid synthesis, contained enriched phosphatase 2C (PP2C), plant‐specific serine/threonine kinase (SnRK2) and abscisic acid‐responsive element binding factor (ABF). These genes were regulated by sly‐miR172a, sly‐miR172e‐3p, sly‐miR393a, sly‐miR2628, sly‐miR5265, sly‐miR5641, sly‐miR6020a‐5p and sly‐miR7696a‐3p (Figure 10). Similarly, jasmonic acid–amido synthetase JAR1, jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) and MYC2 genes were enriched to alpha‐Linolenic acid metabolism associated with jasmonic acid synthesis, and these genes were targeted by sly‐miR162a‐3p, sly‐miR169a‐5p, sly‐miR172a, sly‐miR827‐5p, sly‐miR5083, sly‐miR5298a, sly‐miR5658, sly‐miR6476a and sly‐miR8576 (Figure 10).

26857916|t|Cytoscape platform was further employed to build the network between the drought‐responsive miRNAs and their targets. Totally, 53 miRNAs (such as sly‐miR164, sly‐miR166 and sly‐miR408) targeted 23 genes associated with drought response and tissue development, which included NAC‐domain, HD‐ZIP and BCP (blue copper protein). Sly‐miR5641 targeted 10 drought‐ and development‐related genes such as DRP, LEA, ERF and SBP (Figure 11a). Different gene families were targeted by different numbers of miRNAs. For example, DRP was targeted by 20 miRNAs, followed by GTs (glycosyltransferases) with 16 miRNAs; MYB with 11 miRNAs; NAC with 8 miRNAs; HD‐ZIP with 7 miRNAs; and PSII and ERF with 6 miRNAs (Figure 11a). In plant hormone signal transduction pathway, 23 miRNAs targeted 19 genes that play roles in cell division, plant growth, stomatal closure and stress response. For example, sly‐miR5641 potentially targeted seven genes involved in this pathway. Additionally, sly‐miR393/miR6476 and sly‐miR172/miR5658 potentially targeted 5 and 4 related genes, respectively (Figure 11b).

26857916|t|We performed qRT‐PCR to validate the deep sequencing results with randomly selected eight miRNAs (sly‐miR156a‐5p, sly‐miR169e‐3p, sly‐miR172a, sly‐miR393a‐5p, sly‐miR399a‐5p, sly‐miR408b‐5p, sly‐miR482d‐3p and sly‐miR9472‐5p). For this purpose, we used root tissues of tolerant genotype under control and drought conditions and we figured out the expression levels between drought‐treated versus control samples using log2 fold change () values with three technical and three biological replicates. The expression results of root tissues in tolerant genotype exposed to drought were similar to the deep sequencing data (Figure 12). Three miRNAs (sly‐miR172a, sly‐miR482d‐3p and sly‐miR9472‐5p) were up‐regulated in qRT‐PCR analysis showing a positive correlation with deep sequencing results. Similarly, the other miRNAs were down‐regulated in both qRT‐PCR and high‐throughput sequencing results (Figure 12).

26857916|a|

26857916|t|MicroRNAs, the post‐transcriptional gene regulators, are associated with drought stress evidenced by that miRNAs target a wide range of drought‐related genes, such as ARF, MYB, TCP and GRAS family transcription factors, dehydrins, glutathione S‐transferase (GST) and abscisic acid‐related genes (Ferdous et al., 2015). Using microarray and deep sequencing approaches, several drought‐responsive miRNAs were identified in wheat (Kantar et al., 2011), sorghum (Pasini et al., 2014), sugarcane (Thiebaut et al., 2014), tobacco (Yin et al., 2014), potato (Zhang et al., 2014) and barley (Hackenberg et al., 2015). However, there is no study on systematical identification and expression analysis of miRNAs in tomato response to drought stress using microarray or deep sequencing approaches. In this study, we employed deep sequencing technology to systematically study the effect of drought exposure on miRNA expression in two different tomato genotypes with different drought sensitivity in a tissue‐specific manner. Based on our study, a total of 775 miRNAs were differentially affected by drought; among them, 438 miRNAs were down‐regulated in sensitive genotype (Table S2). We also performed degradome sequencing to identify miRNA targets. Our results were different from that in tomato fruit development (Karlova et al., 2013). In our study, we found 44 target genes, but only the targets of 4 miRNAs (sly‐miR156, sly‐miR160, sly‐miR166 and sly‐miR482) were matched with their results (Table S4). We identified not only the common targets as reported previously but also new targets in tomato. For example, miR156 targets SBP transcription factors, but sly‐miR156d‐3p targeted NAD(H)‐like kinase protein, while sly‐miR156e‐5p targeted four genes including SBP6 and PSII protein. Except the previous report that miR160 was found to target ARF10, ARF16 and ARF17 (Karlova et al., 2013), we also found that miR160 targeted ARF18‐like and PSII protein (Table S4). Several other drought‐related miRNAs targeted several new genes.

26857916|t|Despite the similarity of each member in a same miRNA family (Zhang et al., 2006), they may response differently to drought stress with a tissue‐ and genotype‐dependent manner (Table S2). For example, miR165/166 families were known to target HD‐ZIP III transcription factor which is crucial for leaf polarity, lateral root development and vascular patterning (Elhiti and Stasolla, 2009; Williams et al., 2005; Zhong and Ye, 2007). The expressions of miR165/166 family were generally decreased by drought treatment in other plant species such as rice (Zhou et al., 2010), cotton (Xie et al., 2015), wheat (Kantar et al., 2011) and peach (Eldem et al., 2012). However, the expression of miR166 was increased in Medicago truncatula by drought stress and the expression level was higher in roots in comparison with upper parts (Trindade et al., 2010). Moreover, overexpressions of miR165/166 caused formations of vascular bundles and decreased lateral roots, respectively (Boualem et al., 2008; Zhong and Ye, 2007). These results suggest that miR165/166 families regulate root development and drought response. In our study, drought majorly induced the expression of miR165, but inhibited the expression of miR166 in roots. Additionally, sly‐miR165a‐5p/miR166k and sly‐miR165b‐5p were root specific in sensitive and tolerant genotypes, respectively, whereas sly‐miR166d‐5p was specific to upground tissues of tolerant genotype. Drought did not affect the sensitive genotype significantly in miR165 family. However, in root tissues of tolerant genotype, the expression of miR165b‐5p was decreased by −8.25‐fold after drought treatment, whereas miR165a‐3p was up‐regulated (3.10‐fold) in upground tissues. Sly‐miR166a and sly‐miR166 g‐3p were up‐regulated by 19.50‐ and 2.34‐fold, respectively, in upground tissues of tolerant genotype with dehydration, while miR166d‐5p expression was decreased sharply (−10.98‐fold). In sensitive root samples, sly‐miR166 g‐5p was up‐regulated (11.64‐fold) by drought stress, whereas miR166k expression was decreased at the same time by −18.71‐fold (Table S2). These results suggest that miR165 and miR166 regulated concurrently the drought‐responsive gene expression as positively or negatively.
26857916|a|

26857916|t|One of the main targets of miR398 is copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn‐SOD, CSD), a scavenger enzyme of ROS (reactive oxygen species) detoxifying superoxide radicals (Sunkar et al., 2006). miR398 was down‐regulated by drought in tomato (Luan et al., 2014), M. truncatula (Wang et al., 2011) and cotton (Xie et al., 2015), whereas up‐regulated in another M. truncatula species (Trindade et al., 2010) and wheat (Kantar et al., 2011). Down‐regulation of this miRNA results in increase in CSD expression and tolerance to oxidative stress (Ding et al., 2013). Consistently, the overexpression of miR398 led to down‐regulation of CSD1 and 2 enzymes and caused sensitivity to drought stress in rice (Lu et al., 2010). Our target identification results were consistent with the literature and sly‐miR398a‐3p targeted CSD enzyme also (Table S3). However, sly‐miR398a‐3p expression did not change significantly by drought (Figure 3, Table S2). Sly‐miR398a‐5p was down‐regulated in sensitive upground and tolerant root tissues by 2.65‐ and 1.17‐fold, respectively, with drought treatment (Table S2). This miRNA targeted the development and drought‐related NAC‐domain, HD‐ZIP III and auxin response proteins according to the target prediction results (Table S3). Sly‐miR398a‐5p expressed higher in roots of sensitive genotype in control (1.29‐fold) and drought (4.09‐fold) conditions, but generally miR398 family expression was decreased in upground tissues excluding sly‐miR398a‐3p in sensitive genotype. This up‐regulation (2.03‐fold) may be responsible for the sensitivity of L. esculentum decreasing CSD activity. The other copper proteins plantacyanin (basic blue) and laccase were the predicted targets of miR408 family (Abdel‐Ghany and Pilon, 2008), and the expression of this family usually decreased by dehydration in plant species such as rice (Zhou et al., 2010), M. truncatula (Trindade et al., 2010), Populus (Ren et al., 2012), peach (Eldem et al., 2012) and cotton (Xie et al., 2015). miR408 is necessary for the adjustment of copper levels in cells as the copper deficiency causes production of ROS and oxidative stress (Abdel‐Ghany and Pilon, 2008). The overexpression of miR408 in chickpea led to the inhibition of plantacyanin expression and accumulation of copper and also induction of DREB expression by drought (Hajyzadeh et al., 2015) and overexpression of DREB transcription factors increased drought tolerance in rice (Chen et al., 2008) and Arabidopsis (Xu et al., 2009). According to our results, miR408a‐3p targeted laccase protein as well as other drought‐related genes GTs and LEA proteins (Table S3). The expression of miR408 was decreased after drought treatment. Especially, miR408‐3p was down‐regulated by −10.09‐fold in root tissues of sensitive genotype and this miRNA was suggested as root specific to sensitive genotype as it was expressed only in root tissues of L. esculentum. Besides, miR408a‐3p expression was decreased by −1.02‐fold in upground tissues of tolerant genotypes and was suggested as upground specific in L. esculentum var. cerasiforme. High‐level of decrease in miR408‐3p expression in L. esculentum may be the reason of drought sensitivity by comparison with miR408a‐3p expression change in tolerant genotype.

26857916|t|The expression of miR9552 showed drought‐, tissue‐ and genotype‐specific pattern. Sly‐miR9552a‐3p was only expressed in the roots of sensitive genotype and induced (12.38‐fold) by drought treatment, whereas repressed (−14.16‐fold and −13.64‐fold) in upground tissues of sensitive and tolerant genotypes (Table S2). miR9552 targeted SAUR protein whose expression is regulated by auxin (Abel and Theologis, 1996). Overexpression of SAUR39 gene caused the formation of shorter plants with less leaves in rice indicating negative correlation with auxin biosynthesis (Kant et al., 2009). In contrast, overexpression of SAUR19‐24 genes led to large leaves and hypocotyls implying cell enlargement and plant growth function of SAUR proteins induced by auxin (Spartz et al., 2012). Biotic and abiotic stress induced the differential expression of SAUR genes. For instance, 11 randomly selected SAUR genes were expressed in different tomato tissues and mostly down‐regulated by drought treatment (Wu et al., 2012). However, in our results, SAUR expression was found to be down‐regulated in root tissues, while up‐regulated in upground tissues contrary to miRNA expression profiles indicating tissue‐specific function of drought signalling in tomato. Sly‐miR9552b‐3p was expressed only in root tissues of sensitive genotype under control conditions and suppressed in response to stress treatment, so this miRNA might be suggested as root specific in L. esculentum. One of the predicted targets of this miRNA was UDP‐glucosyltransferase (UGT) (Table S3). Glycosyltransferase enzymes of plants (GTs, EC 2.4) function in secondary metabolism and hormone modification catalysing sugar addition to acceptor molecules such as auxin, ABA and flavonoids (Bowles et al., 2005; Tognetti et al., 2010) and play a role in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance (Vogt and Jones, 2000). One of the common glycosyltransferase UGT71C5 was investigated for the elucidation of ABA impact on drought adaptation in Arabidopsis plants, and when the gene was down‐regulated, drought tolerance increased but decreased after overexpression of UGT71C5 (Liu et al., 2015). These results suggest that the suppression of sly‐miR9552b‐3p expression with drought may increase UGT level in roots and decrease drought tolerance in sensitive genotype.

26857916|t|Plant hormone signal transduction pathway
26857916|a|

26857916|t|Plant hormones play a key role in signalling networks involving in plant development and stress response (Golldack et al., 2014). Different miRNAs regulate the expression of plant hormone‐associated genes in response to different environmental stresses. For example, a stress‐responsive gene ARF which is related with auxin signalling was targeted by sly‐miR160, sly‐miR2199 and sly‐miR6426 in response to drought stress in our study. However, ARF was targeted by miR167 after selenium treatment in Astragalus (Cakir et al., 2015). One of the important phytohormones, ABA, functions centrally in drought and salinity tolerance regulating main transcriptional processes (Cutler et al., 2010). The carotenoid biosynthesis of plant signal transduction pathway is regulated by ABA signals and these signals finally stimulate ABA‐responsive genes regulating the activation/inactivation of type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), SNF1‐related protein kinases (SnRK2s) and ABA‐responsive promoter elements binding factors (ABFs) (Golldack et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2009; Vlad et al., 2009). Our results found that PP2C was targeted by 5 miRNAs such as sly‐miR393a and sly‐miR7696a‐3p (Figures 10 and 11b). miR393 was up‐regulated in rice (Zhou et al., 2010), Arabidopsis (Liu et al., 2008) and wheat (Kantar et al., 2011), while down‐regulated in cotton (Xie et al., 2015) and peach (Eldem et al., 2012). Overexpression of miR393 led to decrease in drought tolerance affecting growth in rice (Xia et al., 2012). However, in this study sly‐miR393 was down‐regulated in root tissues of sensitive genotype, whereas up‐regulated in upground tissues of drought‐responsive tomato (Table S2). miR7696 also targeted ABA signalling pathway, whose expression was significantly altered in upground tissues of sensitive and tolerant genotypes and down‐regulated sharply by −12.33‐fold in sensitive genotype, whereas up‐regulated by 12.25‐fold in tolerant genotype after drought exposure. However, this miRNA was expressed higher in root tissues under control conditions (Figure 3, Table S2). These results indicate differential regulation of PP2C by several miRNAs in root and upground tissues of drought‐sensitive and tolerant genotypes. Similarly, ABF was targeted by sly‐miR172a/miR172e‐3p and sly‐miR5641 (Figures 10 and 11b). When the tomato plants were exposed to drought stress, miR172 family expressed significantly only in upground tissues of sensitive genotype and sly‐miR172a and sly‐miR172e‐3p were down‐regulated in response to drought by −2.01‐ and −1.07‐fold, respectively (Figure 3, Table S2). Sly‐miR172 expression was decreased after drought treatment in rice (Zhou et al., 2010), barley (Hackenberg et al., 2015) and cotton (Xie et al., 2015), whereas up‐regulated in Arabidopsis (Jones‐Rhoades and Bartel, 2004), wheat (Kantar et al., 2011) and Populus (Ren et al., 2012). Sly‐miR5641 was also down‐regulated by −4.31‐fold in root tissues of tolerant genotype (Figure 3, Table S2). The results show that miR172 is different in response to drought among plant species and ABF gene is regulated by different miRNAs in different tissues and genotypes under drought stress.

26857916|t|ABA usually interacts with gibberellic acid (GA) and jasmonate (JA) during plant development and response to drought stress (Golldack et al., 2014). GA signalling is controlled by GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1) receptors and DELLA proteins, the subgroup of GA‐responsive GRAS family transcription factors (Griffiths et al., 2006; Tyler et al., 2004). DELLA protein was targeted by 12 tomato miRNAs containing sly‐miR172, sly‐miR845, sly‐miR5641 and sly‐miR7696 (Figures 10 and 11b). miR845 was expressed differentially in two tissues and genotypes. Sly‐miR845a‐3p was down‐regulated (−8.86‐fold) in sensitive root tissues, whereas up‐regulated (10.09‐fold) in tolerant roots (Figures 3 and 4b, Table S2). In upground tissues, sly‐miR845a‐3p and miR845b‐5p were down‐regulated (~ −11.00‐fold), while miR845a was up‐regulated by 8.84‐fold (Figures 3 and 4c, Table S2). The results not only indicate the different regulatory roles of unique miRNA members in different tissues and genotypes, but also show the function of the miRNAs in more than one signalling way. In JA signalling, there are three key receptor proteins known as Jasmonate Resistant 1 (JAR1), Jasmonate ZIM Domain (JAZ) and Jasmonate Insensitive 1 (JIN1, also known as MYC2) (Kazan and Manners, 2008). JAR1 was targeted by sly‐miR827‐5p (Figures 10 and 11b) whose expression was decreased (−2.50‐fold) in sensitive upground tissues, while increased (1.02‐fold) in tolerant upground samples in response to dehydration stress (Figures 3 and 4c, Table S2). The root tissues were not affected by drought, but generally miR827‐5p expression was higher in roots (Figure 3, Table S2). In same signalling cascade, JAZ receptor was targeted by sly‐miR169a‐5p (Figures 10 and 11b). In our results, sly‐miR169a‐5p expression was decreased in all tissues with drought (Figure 4a, b, Table S2). miR169 targets Jasmonate ZIM Domain (JAZ) and nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A‐3 (NFYA‐3) in tomato fruits (Karlova et al., 2013) and this is further validated in our study (Table S3). Additionally, sly‐miR169 expression was increased in tomato by drought treatment, while three SlNFYA (1/2/3) genes were down‐regulated (Zhang et al., 2011). Moreover, overexpression of sly‐miR169c caused significantly down‐regulation of tomato target genes and induced the increased drought tolerance of tomato (Zhang et al., 2011), whereas overexpression of miR169a led to drought sensitivity in Arabidopsis plants (Li et al., 2008b). Our results were similar with Arabidopsis result indicating NFYA up‐regulation by drought in an ABA‐dependent manner (Li et al., 2008b). ABA‐dependent signalling of drought results in stomatal closure (Figure 10), and stomatal closure is the first response of plants to drought stress (Schroeder et al., 2001). This response is controlled by not only ABA, but also interactions of ABA with the other phytohormones JA, ethylene, auxin and cytokinine (Nemhauser et al., 2006). ABA and JA positively regulate the stoma closure, while auxin and cytokinine regulate negatively and ethylene response depends on tissues and stresses (Daszkowska‐Golec and Szarejko, 2013; Huang et al., 2008; Nemhauser et al., 2006). Excitingly, 48 miRNAs target plant hormone signal transduction pathway (Figures 10 and 11b).

26857916|t|In conclusion, we identified 699 known miRNAs and the majority of them were expressed significantly in response to drought stress in a tissue‐ and genotype‐specific manner. According to the GO and KEGG analyses, the majority of these miRNAs involved in response to hormone stimulus/reactive oxygen species/water deprivation/salt stress, signal transduction, fruit, shoot, seed and root development (Figures 7a and 8) and plant–pathogen interaction, biosynthesis of plant hormones and plant hormone signal transduction pathways (Figures 9 and 10). Drought‐responsive miRNAs (such as sly‐miR160, sly‐miR165, sly‐miR166, sly‐miR171, sly‐miR398, sly‐miR408, sly‐miR827, sly‐miR9472, sly‐miR9476 and sly‐miR9552) regulated drought and development‐associated genes like DRP, HD‐ZIP, MYB, NAC and PSII in root and upground tissues (Figure 11a). Likewise, sly‐miR169, sly‐miR172, sly‐miR393, sly‐miR5641, sly‐miR5658 and sly‐miR7997 function in plant hormone signal transduction pathway and related proteins (Figures 10 and 11b). These results reveal drought‐responsive miRNA profiles of drought‐sensitive and drought‐tolerant tomato genotypes in tissue‐specific pattern and contribute to the development of drought‐tolerant tomato plants.

26857916|t|The seeds of drought‐sensitive (CGN24169: Lycopersicon esculentum, L.M.I‐56) and drought‐tolerant (CGN18399: L. esculentum var. cerasiforme, Tomatillo; PI 187002 selection 1) tomato genotypes were obtained from the Centre for Genetic Resources, The Netherlands (CGN), Wageningen University and Research Centre, The Netherlands. The seeds were surface‐sterilized with 75% (v/v) ethanol for 15 s, followed by 20% bleach (v/v) for 15 min and washed with sterilized distilled water for at least three times. Sterilized seeds were germinated on MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium (pH 5.8), containing 3% sucrose and 0.8% agar in a growth chamber with fluorescent light (~1400/mol2/ms) under 16‐h light /8‐h dark cycle at 25 ± 2 °C for 14 days. For drought treatment, 14‐day‐old seedlings were exposed to 5% polyethylene glycol for 7 days. For control and drought treatments, four seeds were germinated in Magenta boxes and the experiments were replicated six times in six individual vessels. After stress treatment for 7 days, the root and upground tissues were collected from seedlings and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at −80 °C till RNA extraction.

26857916|t|Total RNAs were extracted from root and upground tissues of drought‐sensitive and tolerant tomato plants using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and quantity of RNAs were measured with a NanoDrop ND‐2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA isolation was carried out individually for each sample with four biological replicates, then the RNAs were sent to BGI (Shenzen, China) for small RNA library construction and high‐throughput sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.

26857916|t|Identification of tomato miRNAs using deep sequencing
26857916|a|

26857916|t|The raw reads were first cleaned up, including removing adapter sequences and eliminating low‐quality reads. Then, the length distribution of clean reads was categorized to analyse the composition of small RNA data, and 16‐ to 28‐nt‐length small RNAs were used for further analysis. High‐quality clean small RNA tags were mapped to tomato genome (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.4_release/ITAG2.4_genomic.fasta) by SOAP (short oligonucleotide alignment program) to find out their expression and distribution on the genome (Li et al., 2008a). Then, the matched tags were aligned to NCBI GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) (Benson et al., 2015) and Rfam 11.0 (http://rfam.xfam.org/) (Burge et al., 2013) databases using BLASTall and BLASTn to determine rRNA, tRNA, snRNA and snoRNAs. Following this search, repeat‐containing RNAs, sense and antisense exon and intron sequences were detected, and fully matched all RNA types excluding miRNAs were gotten rid of. Then, for annotation of remaining sequences, conserved miRNAs were mapped to miRBase Release (v21 on June 26th, 2014) database (http://www.mirbase.org/ftp.shtml) (Kozomara and Griffiths‐Jones, 2014) and researched for L. esculentum miRNAs. The expression of miRNAs was calculated simultaneously by summing the count of tags overlapping at least 16 nt and/or two mismatches with aligned known miRNAs in database. DEGseq package was used for differential expression analysis of miRNAs, after normalizing raw read numbers with trimmed mean of M‐values (TMM) normalization method (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010; Wang et al., 2010). For normalization, firstly the normalization factors were calculated and then normalized read numbers were determined using following formula: [raw read counts/(library size × normalization factor) × 106] (Bai et al., 2014). Fold changes were calculated with the formula [log2(normalized read numbers of group2/group1)]. Then, for the identification of significantly expressed miRNAs, the criteria were used as if (fold change ≥1 or ≤−1) and (P or q‐value <0.05) (Storey, 2003). To show differential expression profile among drought‐sensitive and drought‐tolerant tomato root and upgrounds, heatmap was constructed for the most abundant 130 conserved using Qlucore Omics Explorer 3.0 (Qlucore AB) (http://www.qlucore.com/).

26857916|t|Target prediction, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis
26857916|a|

26857916|t|Significantly expressed miRNAs were used for target prediction using psRNATarget server (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/) with default parameters, including maximum expectation score (3.0), length for complementarity (17 bp) and range of central mismatch (10–11 nt) (Dai and Zhao, 2011). Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) cDNA library, version 2.4 (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.4_release/ITAG2.4_cdna.fasta) was used to predict target genes, and for functional annotation and enrichment analysis of target genes, agriGO (GO Analysis Toolkit and Database for Agricultural Community) web‐based tool was used (Du et al., 2010). Firstly, the protein sequences of target genes (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.4_release/ITAG2.4_proteins.fasta) were aligned against Arabidopsis protein sequences (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Sequences/blast_datasets/TAIR10_blastsets/TAIR10_pep_20101214_updated) to find out the homologues. Then, the matched gene list was submitted to agriGO query list as TAIR10 locus ID, and GO classification was performed. The enriched GO terms of biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories were visualized with DAGs (directed acyclic hierarchical graph) and bar charts and pathway analyses were performed using KEGG (The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg1.html) using target gene IDs as queries (Kanehisa et al., 2014). The relationship between drought‐responsive miRNAs and their putative targets was visualized using Cytoscape network platform (Saito et al., 2012).

26857916|t|Validation of miRNA expressions with qRT‐PCR analysis
26857916|a|

26857916|t|Total RNAs of tolerant root tissues belonging to drought‐treated and control samples isolated for deep sequencing were used to validate miRNA expression results. Firstly, stem‐loop reverse transcription (RT) was carried out using TaqMan® MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A total of 15 μL RT reaction contained 1 mm dNTPs with dTTP, 1× RT buffer, 50U MultiScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase, 3.8U RNase inhibitor and 500 ng total RNAs and nuclease‐free water. Also 1.3 μm miRNA‐specific stem‐loop RT primers were used to generate single‐stranded cDNA for miRNAs (Table S6). The following temperature program was used to perform RT reaction as 30 min at 16 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, and then holding at 4 °C. Before quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR), the cDNAs were diluted in 100 μL DNase/RNase‐free water. Eight miRNAs (sly‐miR156a‐5p, sly‐miR169e‐3p, sly‐miR172a, sly‐miR393a‐5p, sly‐miR399a‐5p, sly‐miR408b‐5p, sly‐miR482d‐3p and sly‐miR9472‐5p) were randomly selected, and specific forward primers and universal reverse primer were designed to amplify the miRNAs (Table S6). qRT‐PCRs were carried out using 2× SensiFAST SYBR® Hi‐ROX mix (Bioline, Taunton, MA) on a Applied Biosystems 7300 Real‐Time PCR System. Briefly, each 20 μL reactions contained 10 μL SensiFAST mix, 6 μL nuclease‐free water, 2 μL cDNA product and 2 μL primer mix. The reactions were performed with the following temperature program: 10 min at 95 °C for enzyme activation, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 60 s at 60 °C for annealing/extension, followed by a dissociation step for 1 cycle of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 15 s. Three technical replicates for each biological reactions and three biological replicates were performed for root tissues of tolerant genotype. Actin‐7 gene was used for normalization of qRT‐PCR data. The fold changes were calculated using 2‐(ΔΔCt) values, and relative expressions were shown as log2 fold changes.

26857916|a|

26857916|t|For degradome sequencing, the RNAs were first pooled from all samples at a same amount. Firstly, polyadenylated RNAs were isolated with oligo‐d(T) bead extraction. Then, MmeI recognition site carrying 5′‐RNA adapter was ligated to 5′‐end that has mRNA fragments of miRNA‐induced cleavage. Afterwards, the fragments were converted to cDNA by reverse transcription and amplified by PCR (German et al., 2009). The PCR products of degradome library were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing system, and the adapter sequences, low‐quality reads and N‐containing fragments were filtered from the raw reads. After preprocessing, sRNAs were eliminated by Genbank and Rfam 11.0 databases, and then KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2014) and NR (nonredundant) (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) databases were used for the annotation of cleaved target genes. Then, clean tags were matched to the tomato genome (ITAG2.4 Release cDNA library) by SOAP2.20 (Li et al., 2009) with allowing only two mismatches, and with the classification of clean tags, the sense strand of tomato cDNA library were used to predict miRNA cleavage sites using CleaveLand v3.0.1 (August 26, 2011) pipeline (Addo‐Quaye et al., 2009). The potential targets of miRNAs were analysed by PAREsnip software with P‐value <0.05 (Folkes et al., 2012), and T‐plot figures were drawn.

27528604|t|The Vesicle Priming Factor CAPS Functions as a Homodimer via C2 Domain Interactions to Promote Regulated Vesicle Exocytosis*
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Neurotransmitters and peptide hormones are secreted by regulated vesicle exocytosis. CAPS (also known as CADPS) is a 145-kDa cytosolic and peripheral membrane protein required for vesicle docking and priming steps that precede Ca2+-triggered vesicle exocytosis. CAPS binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and SNARE proteins and is proposed to promote SNARE protein complex assembly for vesicle docking and priming. We characterized purified soluble CAPS as mainly monomer in equilibrium with small amounts of dimer. However, the active form of CAPS bound to PC12 cell membranes or to liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2 and Q-SNARE proteins was mainly dimer. CAPS dimer formation required its C2 domain based on mutation or deletion studies. Moreover, C2 domain mutations or deletions resulted in a loss of CAPS function in regulated vesicle exocytosis, indicating that dimerization is essential for CAPS function. Comparison of the CAPS C2 domain to a structurally defined Munc13-1 C2A domain dimer revealed conserved residues involved in CAPS dimerization. We conclude that CAPS functions as a C2 domain-mediated dimer in regulated vesicle exocytosis. The unique tandem C2-PH domain of CAPS may serve as a PI(4,5)P2-triggered switch for dimerization. CAPS dimerization may be coupled to oligomeric SNARE complex assembly for vesicle docking and priming.

27528604|t|Introduction
27528604|a|

27528604|t|In regulated exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane in response to Ca2+ elevations, releasing cargo such as peptide hormones or neurotransmitters to the extracellular space. CAPS3 (also known as CAPS-1, CADPS, and Unc-31p) was discovered by its activity in promoting Ca2+-triggered dense core vesicle exocytosis in permeable neuroendocrine cells (1, 2). Subsequent studies demonstrated the essential role of CAPS in the docking and priming of dense core vesicles and synaptic vesicles in endocrine and neural cells (3–14). CAPS proteins contain at least three important functional domains corresponding to the C2 domain, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and Munc13 homology domain 1 (MHD1) (Fig. 6A) (15). Based on sequence homology in C-terminal regions, CAPS is a member of a CATCHR (complexes associated with tethering containing helical rods) family of tethering/priming proteins that operate at various stages in the secretory pathway (16–18). Munc13-1/2 proteins in this family function similarly to CAPS but non-redundantly at priming steps in vesicle exocytosis (3, 7, 12, 19, 21).

27528604|t|The three annotated CAPS domains are important for activity in regulated vesicle exocytosis. The C2 domain of CAPS is essential for nervous system function in Caenorhabditis elegans indicated by the uncoordinated phenotype of unc-31(e714) and unc-31(ox299) strains that harbor point mutations in the C2 domain of the conserved worm CAPS ortholog UNC-31p (22). The exact role of the C2 domain in CAPS function was unknown and is revealed in the current study. The adjacent PH domain of CAPS has been characterized as a PI(4,5)P2-binding domain required for CAPS activity in supporting regulated exocytosis in cells and for enabling PI(4,5)P2- and SNARE-dependent liposome fusion (4, 19, 23–25). The PH and C2 domains of CAPS are closely adjacent (Fig. 6A) and could exhibit mutual regulation as in other tandem domain proteins (26). Last, CAPS interacts with Q-SNAREs (syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25) and, at lower affinity, with the R-SNARE (VAMP2) that comprise the neuronal SNARE complex (27). SNARE binding by CAPS is mediated by MHD1 or more C-terminal domains within the CATCHR region (15, 28). Current models for function in vesicle exocytosis suggest that CAPS on dense core vesicles (3) engages PI(4,5)P2 and Q-SNAREs on the plasma membrane via its PH and MHD1 domains, respectively, to promote SNARE complex assembly for vesicle docking and priming (17, 29).

27528604|t|CAPS promotes the formation of dimers of SNARE complexes on liposomes, but it was unclear whether this was mediated by the dimerization of CAPS (23, 30). Early hydrodynamic studies of partially purified protein suggested that CAPS was a dimer (2). However, three protein bands were identified in native gel electrophoresis of purified CAPS, but the oligomerization state of these CAPS forms was not established (31). Here we report that purified soluble recombinant CAPS is in monomer-dimer equilibrium favoring the monomer but that the membrane-bound active form of CAPS is a dimer. PI(4,5)P2 and Q-SNARE interactions stabilize the CAPS dimer. The role of the CAPS C2 domain in mediating homodimerization was revealed by studies of the mammalian counterparts of unc-31 C2 domain mutants (22) and a C2 domain deletion that exhibit altered dimer formation and loss of function in vesicle exocytosis. Last, analysis suggests that CAPS dimerizes similarly to Munc13-1/2 using conserved homodimerization residues in its C2 domain.

27528604|t|Biochemical Characterization of CAPS Oligomerization
27528604|a|

27528604|t|We reported that native CAPS is a dimer, but this analysis was conducted with partially purified protein using indirect hydrodynamic criteria (2). However, a reassessment of oligomerization with a highly purified active recombinant CAPS-Myc-His protein (32) indicated that the protein migrated in blue native gel electrophoresis as a major 350-kDa and a minor 700 kDa band (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the protein with SDS, which was effective at disassembling oligomeric molecular mass standards, collapsed the 700-kDa but not the 350-kDa form of the protein (Fig. 1B). This suggested that the 350 kDa band corresponds to a monomer, whereas the 700-kDa band is an oligomer. Consistent with this, zero length cross-linking partially converted the CAPS-Myc-His monomer to an oligomer that resisted SDS-induced disassembly (Fig. 1C). The minor amounts (∼6%) of oligomer in CAPS-Myc-His (n = 27) did not differ significantly from that detected in native cytosolic CAPS (n = 11), indicating that epitope tags were not responsible for oligomer formation (e.g. see Fig. 4C). The molecular mass of CAPS-Myc-His on SDS-PAGE is ∼145 kDa, which indicates that the 350-kDa CAPS-Myc-His form in blue native gels migrates as a non-globular protein with an oblate shape. To assess its native molecular mass independent of shape, purified CAPS-Myc-His was analyzed by analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation, which showed that the major species of soluble CAPS-Myc-His is a ∼150-kDa monomer (Fig. 1D). Minor amounts of a higher molecular weight oligomer(s) were not well resolved by this method.

27528604|t|Gel filtration studies indicated that the dominant form of CAPS-Myc-His migrates with a Stokes radius (RS) of ∼59 Å similar to a 350-kDa globular protein (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with a moderately elongated 145-kDa monomer with an RS/Rmin value of ∼1.7 (33). The 0.17 Kav monomer fractions from gel filtration analyzed by native gels contained ratios of monomer to oligomer similar to the input, indicating that gel-filtered monomer partially converts to oligomer (Fig. 2A). Long exposure of the Western blot revealed oligomer in the 0.06–0.12 Kav fractions (Fig. 2B), but analysis of these fractions 1 day later showed substantial conversion to monomer (Fig. 2C). We conclude that soluble CAPS-Myc-His is in dynamic monomer-oligomer equilibrium favoring monomer.

27528604|t|Atomic Force and Single Molecule Microscopy
27528604|a|

27528604|t|To further assess the oligomerization state of CAPS, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and single-molecule microscopy. AFM measures protein volume and can be used to determine oligomer stoichiometry (34). The volume of CAPS-Myc-His was measured after drying directly onto mica or after it was added to a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) on mica with or without PI(4,5)P2. The majority of CAPS-Myc-His on mica (Fig. 3A) or on the SLB lacking PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3B, top) was monomer. However, the inclusion of PI(4,5)P2 in SLBs strikingly enhanced the amount of CAPS-Myc-His present as a dimer (Fig. 3B, bottom). The stimulatory effect of PI(4,5)P2 on CAPS-Myc-His oligomerization was confirmed in native gel electrophoresis studies showing that CAPS-Myc-His oligomerized upon incubation with PI(4,5)P2 micelles (Fig. 3C). PI(4,5)P2 was the most effective phosphoinositide for inducing oligomerization (Fig. 3D). The results indicate that CAPS-Myc-His exists in two states and that PI(4,5)P2 binding promotes the formation of oligomers that correspond to dimers.

27528604|t|CAPS oligomer is a dimer. A, atomic force microscopy volume analysis of purified CAPS dried onto mica (n = 108). Representative images of AFM field (left), representative images of single CAPS-Myc-His molecules (middle), and histograms of the CAPS-Myc-His volume distribution (right) are shown. Volume data were fit to a double Gaussian with volumes of 109 nm3 for monomer and 264 nm3 for dimer. B, atomic force microscopy analysis of purified CAPS-Myc-His added to SLB (top, n = 448) or SLB containing PI(4,5)P2 (bottom, n = 238) detected monomers at 94 nm3 or monomers at 115 nm3 plus dimer at 261 nm3, respectively. Inclusion of PI(4,5)P2 in SLBs significantly increased the amount of CAPS-Myc-His dimer (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcox test). C, CAPS-Myc-His dimers increased upon PI(4,5)P2 addition as indicated by BN-PAGE of 5 μg of CAPS-Myc-His incubated with 1.5 μg of PI(4,5)P2 for 0–30 min. Arrows, high mobility monomer and low mobility dimer. Results shown are representative of six experiments. D, incubations and analysis similar to C were conducted with the indicated phospholipids showing that CAPS-Myc-His dimers were preferentially induced (-fold increase is shown) by PI(4,5)P2 (mean ± S.D. (error bars); *, p < 0.001, n = 5). E, pull-down of single CAPS-mKate2-His molecules. TIRF microscopy images showed puncta when CAPS-mKate2-His was retained by His antibody (middle) but not with control antibody (right). Scale bar, 10 μm. F, TIRF images (collected at 2 Hz) showing a one-step photobleach event for immobilized CAPS-mKate2-His. Image size is 2.5 × 2.5 μm. G, representative fluorescence intensity versus time analysis for 1-step and 2-step photobleach events for CAPS-mKate2-His. H, percentages of puncta exhibiting two photobleaching steps were quantified for CAPS-mKate2-His tethered by His antibodies (n = 486), CAPS-mKate2-His bound to PI(4,5)P2 SLBs (n = 296), CAPS-mKate2 (lacking His tag) bound to PI(4,5)P2 SLBs (n = 209), and mKate2-His (n = 307) or (mKate2)2-His (n = 117) tethered by His antibodies. Note that the (mKate2)2-His dimer was only 50% pure and contaminated with fluorescent monomeric mKate2. Values are mean ± S.D.

27528604|t|Single molecule microscopy can be used to determine oligomeric state by monitoring the number of photobleaching steps for fluorescently tagged proteins (35). CAPS-mKate2-His molecules were held by His antibodies (Fig. 3E), and photobleaching steps were monitored by total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Fig. 3, F and G). As controls, monomeric mKate2 was shown to exhibit one-step bleaching, whereas dimeric mKate2 exhibited an increased number of two-step bleaches (Fig. 3H). CAPS-mKate2-His mainly exhibited 1-step bleaching, but ∼5% of the molecules exhibited two-step bleaching, indicating that a minor population of dimers is present (Fig. 3H). The inclusion of PI(4,5)P2 markedly enhanced dimerization of the CAPS-mKate2-His protein (Fig. 3H). To exclude the role of the His tag, we prepared a CAPS-mKate2 protein, which exhibited similar PI(4,5)P2-enhanced dimerization (Fig. 3H). Collectively, the AFM and single molecule studies indicate that CAPS oligomers correspond to dimers and that PI(4,5)P2 enhances CAPS dimerization.

27528604|t|CAPS Dimers Are Functional in Vesicle Exocytosis
27528604|a|

27528604|t|To determine the functional significance of the oligomeric states of CAPS, we assessed whether there was a preferential association of CAPS monomer or dimer with PC12 cell membranes. CAPS is a soluble cytosolic protein that partitions onto membranes (3, 25, 36). PC12 cells were mechanically permeabilized and washed to remove soluble contents (Fig. 4A (i)). Extensively washed permeable cells retain small amounts of bound native CAPS (4) that is efficiently extracted by a high salt wash (Fig. 4B) or by direct electrophoresis into native gels (not shown). In contrast to native cytosolic CAPS, which was ∼5% dimer, the extracted membrane-bound CAPS was entirely dimer as analyzed on native gels (Fig. 4C). Similar studies were conducted by adding purified CAPS-Myc-His to the permeable cells (Fig. 4A (ii)). The addition of purified CAPS to permeable PC12 cells stimulates Ca2+-dependent dense core vesicle exocytosis (4, 31). We tested the activity of the added purified CAPS-Myc-His and compared this with the activity of bound CAPS-Myc-His after a wash to remove unbound CAPS-Myc-His (Fig. 4A (iii)). CAPS-Myc-His bound to the permeable cells was exclusively dimer (Fig. 4D) and exhibited ∼50% of the activity (Fig. 4E, curve iii) of added CAPS-Myc-His (Fig. 4E, curve ii) in promoting Ca2+-dependent secretion. Control studies showed that the activity of bound CAPS-Myc-His was inhibited by neutralizing CAPS antibodies but not by control IgGs (Fig. 4F). Strikingly, the bound CAPS-Myc-His dimer represented only ∼1% of the input CAPS-Myc-His (Fig. 4D) but accounted for 40–60% of the detected activity (Fig. 4E). The results indicate that dimer is the active membrane-bound form of CAPS associated with Ca2+-triggered exocytosis.

27528604|t|CAPS dimer is the functional form of CAPS. A, PC12 cells were passed through a ball homogenizer (10-μm clearance) to tear the plasma membrane and were washed in KGlu/BSA to remove cytosol (i). Purified CAPS-Myc-His was added to 20 nm (ii), and cell ghosts were washed with KGlu/BSA to remove unbound CAPS-Myc-His (iii). These three states were assessed for activity in E. B, washed cell ghosts (i) were sequentially extracted with 300 mm NaCl (high salt (HS)), 1% Triton X-100 (TX100), and SDS sample buffer (SB) with boiling. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting from SDS-PAGE with CAPS antibody. Results shown are representative of three studies. C, cytosol from PC12 cells (left lane) was compared with HS extract of endogenous CAPS from cell ghosts (i, right lane) in electrophoresis by CN-PAGE and Western blotting with CAPS antibody. Results shown are representative of four studies. D, purified CAPS-Myc-His (1% of input shown) was compared with 50% of HS extract from cell ghosts (iii) in electrophoresis by CN-PAGE and Western blotting with Myc antibody. Results shown are representative of two studies. Endogenous CAPS (C) or exogenous CAPS-Myc-His (D) retained by PC12 cell ghosts migrated as dimer. E, Ca2+-dependent norepinephrine secretion was monitored by rotating disk electrode voltammetry from cell ghosts indicated as i, ii, and iii in A. Ca2+ was injected at zero time. The results from three studies were averaged in the histogram (means ± S.E. (error bars)); *, p < 0.05. F, neutralizing CAPS antibodies inhibited the stimulation of secretion by prebound CAPS (iii).

27528604|t|Binding to SNARE proteins and PI(4,5)P2 is required for CAPS activity in exocytosis (15, 19), so we assessed the oligomeric state of purified CAPS bound to liposomes containing Q-SNAREs and PI(4,5)P2. The CAPS-Myc-His bound to Q-SNARE-, PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes purified by flotation (Fig. 5A) exhibited increased dimer compared with input (Fig. 5, B and C). CAPS-Myc-His dimers were not evident in flotation studies with PC/PS-containing liposomes (Fig. 5, B and C) or with liposomes containing only PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5C). Although these results appeared to differ from the AFM studies with PI(4,5)P2-containing SLBs (Fig. 3B), we attribute this to the dissociation of CAPS-Myc-His during flotation when bound at low affinity to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. The recovery of CAPS-Myc-His from liposomes containing only Q-SNAREs was also low (Fig. 5C) but corresponds to the synergy between PI(4,5)P2 and Q-SNAREs for CAPS activity on liposomes (23). Collectively, the results show that CAPS dimers preferentially associate with PI(4,5)P2 and Q-SNAREs and that membrane-bound dimers are the functionally active form of CAPS.

27528604|t|CAPS C2 Domain Mediates Dimerization
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Additional evidence for the importance of dimerization in CAPS activity and for the role of the C2 domain in dimer formation was provided by studies of CAPS C2 domain mutants. Mutant proteins assessed were rat CAPS(G476E) and CAPS(L468K) plus variants (Fig. 6A) corresponding to the unc-31(e714) and unc-31(ox299) alleles in C. elegans, respectively (22). We also generated a C2 domain deletion protein CAPS(ΔC2). Mutant proteins were purified as Myc-His fusion proteins and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis to determine oligomerization state (Fig. 6, B and C), and in the permeable PC12 cell assay to determine activity (Fig. 6E). The alleles at Leu-468 (L468E and L468K) had significantly reduced dimer and exhibited loss of function in the permeable cell assay (Fig. 6, B, C, and E). The deletion construct CAPS(ΔC2) also exhibited reduced dimerization as well as reduced activity (Fig. 6, B, C, and E). We also tested the CAPS(ΔC2) protein with PI(4,5)P2 and found that PI(4,5)P2-induced dimerization was similarly attenuated (Fig. 6D).

27528604|t|C2 Domain Is Essential for CAPS Function in Cells
27528604|a|

27528604|t|We assessed the activity of the C2 domain mutants in regulated dense core vesicle exocytosis in live PC12 cells (19). Cells expressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-EGFP as vesicle cargo (Fig. 7A) were depolarized to promote Ca2+ influx. Vesicle fusion events were detected by the brightening of BDNF-EGFP in TIRF microscopy (Fig. 7B). The knockdown of CAPS in PC12 cells with shRNA (>95% reduction in CAPS (19)) strongly reduced Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis (Fig. 7C). Full rescue was achieved by expressing a CAPS-TagRFP construct harboring silent mutations that bypass the shRNA (Fig. 7D). By contrast, CAPS(G476E), CAPS(ΔC2), or CAPS(L468K) proteins all failed to rescue Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis (Fig. 7, D–F) despite normal expression (Fig. 8). Intriguingly, CAPS(G476E) expression also strongly reduced the number of dense core vesicles visible in the TIRF field, whereas expression of other mutants did not (data not shown). To determine whether reduced exocytosis with CAPS(G476E) expression (Fig. 7D) was solely attributable to the reduced number of vesicles in the TIRF field, the data were replotted as the number of fusion events normalized to the number of vesicles in the TIRF field. CAPS(G476E) was confirmed as strong loss of function for exocytosis as were the CAPS(L468K) and ΔC2 CAPS mutants (Fig. 7G). The live cell studies agree with the permeable cell activity assay results (Fig. 6E) and further indicate the essential nature of the C2 domain for CAPS function in vesicle exocytosis.

27528604|t|CAPS(G476E) Cluster Dense Core Vesicles
27528604|a|

27528604|t|CAPS in PC12 cells is cytoplasmic as well as bound to dense core vesicles (3). CAPS(G476E) was loss of function for vesicle exocytosis (Fig. 7, D and G) but also interfered with the transit of vesicles to the plasma membrane. To further assess this, we determined the localization of CAPS(G476E) in cells by confocal microscopy. Expression of wild-type CAPS-EGFP or CAPS-TagRFP resulted in a global cytoplasmic distribution that largely obscured the dense core vesicle localization previously shown by TIRF microscopy (3) (Fig. 8, A and B). CAPS(L468K) and CAPS(ΔC2) proteins were expressed well and localized similarly to the wild-type protein as cytoplasmic. In striking contrast, CAPS(G476E) localized to large structures within the cells (Fig. 8, A and C) that also contained dense core vesicle proteins synaptotagmin-1 and chromogranin B but not Golgi proteins TGN-38 or syntaxin-6 (Fig. 8C). This suggested that CAPS(G476E) expression induced the cytoplasmic clustering of mature dense core vesicles. We confirmed this by electron microscopy, which revealed cytoplasmic clusters of intact dense core vesicles in cells expressing CAPS(G476E) (Fig. 8D).

Scale bar, 15 μm. D, electron micrograph of fixed PC12 cell expressing CAPS-GFP or CAPS(G476E)-GFP. An enlarged region containing clusters of dense core vesicles is shown. Scale bar, 200 nm. Clustering was determined by the number of additional vesicles in a 400-nm radius surrounding a vesicle; binning results for 0–1 or ≥2 vesicles/circle are shown. CAPS(G476E)-GFP (n = 7 sections) significantly increased the percentage of vesicles with ≥2 adjacent vesicles (**, p < 0.001) compared with CAPS-GFP (n = 8 sections). Error bars indicate S.D. E, CAPS(G476E) clustering of dense core vesicles is dependent on the vesicle binding domain of CAPS. C-terminal truncation of 135 residues from CAPS abolished vesicle clustering by CAPS(G476E). Scale bar, 15 μm. F, model of dense core vesicle clustering by CAPS(G476E) depicting C2 domain self-interactions and C-terminal vesicle-binding domain.
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Vesicle clustering by CAPS(G476E) may be due to its increased oligomerization (Fig. 6B) coupled with its binding to dense core vesicles (Fig. 8F). CAPS binding to dense core vesicles requires a C-terminal domain (Fig. 6A) (3, 25). We constructed a C-terminally truncated version of CAPS(G476E) and found that vesicle clustering was eliminated (Fig. 8E). The results indicate that the G476E mutation enhances CAPS self-interactions even in trans across vesicle membranes. Such results are consistent with a role for the C2 domain in CAPS dimerization (Fig. 8F).

27528604|t|Bioinformatic Analysis of CAPS C2 Domain
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Dimerization may be mediated by homotypic interactions between C2 domains. Structures of C2 domain homodimers have been reported for C2B of RIM1α, C2B of Rgp3, and C2A of Munc13-1 (37, 38). Analysis of these structures reveals several conserved patterns for C2 homodimer formation. Residues involved in dimerization, while uniquely positioned on each structure, are in the same β-strands. These residues interact with residues on other β strands or with loops that connect the β strands. Each of the three structures contains an electrostatic lysine-aspartate interaction stabilized by interaction with an aromatic residue and by a hydrogen bond from a third residue (see below). We determined whether any of these dimerization residues were conserved in CAPS by conducting C2 domain alignments with Cn3D, which supplements traditional sequence alignment methods with structural data (39).

27528604|t|Alignments revealed that residues involved in Munc13-1 C2A homodimerization are conserved in the CAPS C2 domain (Fig. 9A). Specifically, two types of interactions are conserved. Both C2 domains exhibit a characteristic partial chelation of a charged residue by three residues on the opposing domain and exhibit a lysine-glutamate electrostatic interaction (Fig. 9A). The positions of these latter residues are flipped between CAPS C2 and Munc13-1 C2A, which could function to prevent CAPS-Munc13-1 heterodimer formation. To test the sequence alignment predictions, we generated two charge reversal mutants in the CAPS C2 domain that are predicted to reduce dimerization. In accord with prediction, CAPS(K428D) and CAPS(D472K) exhibited impaired dimerization (Fig. 9, B and C). Importantly, both CAPS C2 domain mutants showed reduced activity in the permeable PC12 cell assay (Fig. 9D). We suggest that the mechanism of C2 domain homodimerization is conserved between the CAPS C2 domain and the Munc13-1 C2A domain.

27528604|t|Essential Role of CAPS C2 Domain
27528604|a|

27528604|t|We provide evidence that the C2 domain is essential for CAPS activity as a regulator of vesicle exocytosis. This conclusion initially emerged from sequencing the unc-31(e714) and unc-31(ox299) loss of function alleles in C. elegans that correspond to rat CAPS(G476E) and CAPS(L468K), respectively (22). These single point mutations in the CAPS C2 domain are separated by seven residues. Studies of regulated dense core vesicle exocytosis (Figs. 6 and 7) showed that CAPS(G476E) was entirely inactive, whereas CAPS(L468K) was partially active. Importantly, CAPS(ΔC2) exhibited no activity (Figs. 6 and 7). The results strongly indicate that the C2 domain is required for CAPS activity in Ca2+-dependent dense core vesicle exocytosis.

27528604|t|The CAPS C2 domain lacks the canonical array of five aspartate residues characteristic of Ca2+-dependent, PS-binding C2 domains (40). We were unable to demonstrate Ca2+-dependent PS binding for CAPS C2 domain constructs that we have produced. However, C2 domains in proteins also mediate protein-protein interactions (38, 41–47). C2 domains can also homodimerize, such as in piccolo, dysferlin, RIM1a, Munc13-1, and Rgp3 (38, 48–50). That the CAPS C2 domain mediates homodimerization is suggested by the findings that monomeric CAPS in solution is in dynamic equilibrium with a pool of dimer and that a large number of C2 domain mutant CAPS proteins (L468E, L468A, L468K, K428D, D472K, and ΔC2) exhibit strong reductions in dimerization. It is unlikely that these mutant CAPS proteins are either globally or locally misfolded because they express at wild-type levels in cells, bind PI(4,5)P2 similarly to wild-type CAPS, and exhibit similar patterns of limited proteolysis.4 It is likely that these mutant proteins exhibit reduced affinity for C2 domain self-interactions.

27528604|t|The CAPS(G476E) mutant corresponding to the unc-31(e714) allele has unusual properties that nonetheless support the idea of C2 domain-mediated oligomerization. CAPS(G476E) is strongly loss of function at the level of vesicle exocytosis (Figs. 6 and 7), and it also clusters dense core vesicles in the cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 8). We interpret this to indicate that the G476E C2 domain gains affinity for self-interaction so that it dimerizes in trans across membranes (Fig. 8F). Indeed, CAPS(G476E) exhibits a very strong tendency to oligomerize as dimers as well as possible tetramers (Fig. 6B). We cannot eliminate the possibility that the C2 domain in this mutant is locally misfolded by substitution of a small uncharged side chain by a charged side chain. The G476A allele, by contrast, exhibited wild-type properties. Gly-476 is highly conserved in CAPS and in other C2 domains (Fig. 9A), residing near the beginning of a flexible linker that connects two β strands. Whether the Gly to Glu substitution promotes local unfolding of the C2 domain or introduces additional electrostatic interactions is unclear, but the G476E substitution appears to strongly enhance C2-C2 domain interactions.

27528604|t|That both decreased (e.g. CAPS(ΔC2) and CAPS(L468K)) as well as increased (e.g. CAPS(G476E)) dimerization result in loss of CAPS function suggests that a cycle of dimerization and its reversal plays a role in CAPS function. CAPS dimerization may need to be locally activated with correct timing such that premature dimerization inhibits activity. Consistent with this, complete dephosphorylation inactivates CAPS and shifts it toward an oligomeric state (31). It should be noted that the current work reassigns the speculated dimer-tetramer equilibrium of that previous study (31) to a monomer-dimer equilibrium.

27528604|t|Distinct Roles for Dimerization in CAPS and Munc13-1 Function
27528604|a|

27528604|t|CAPS and Munc13-1 proteins comprise a subgroup of CATCHR family proteins exhibiting ∼40% sequence similarity in a ∼500-residue region that is C-terminal to the C2 domain of CAPS. Dimerization of the Munc13-1 protein has not been directly determined but is proposed based on C2A-C2A dimer structures (38). Mutations that disrupt C2A-C2A dimers (K32E) were found to enhance Munc13-1 function in neurons, suggesting that Munc13-1 monomers are active (50). A proposed mechanism for Munc13-1 activation involves RIM1-induced dissociation of C2A-C2A dimers to activate Munc13-1 as a monomer (38, 50). This contrasts with our results for CAPS, which indicate that C2 domain-mediated dimerization is required for function in vesicle exocytosis. The monomer-dimer equilibrium strongly favoring monomer for CAPS indicates that the affinity for self-interaction between soluble CAPS monomers is low, which contrasts with the reported high affinity for Munc13-1 C2A-C2A interactions (38).
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Although CAPS and Munc13-1 are each proposed to promote the assembly of SNARE complexes for vesicle priming, the two proteins function distinctively and non-redundantly (3, 7, 12, 19, 21). CAPS promotes the formation of dimers of heterotrimeric SNARE complexes on liposomes, which may be mediated by multivalent interactions of an active membrane dimer of CAPS with SNARE proteins (30). This is similar to mechanisms suggested for a number of dimeric tethering factors (51, 52). By contrast, Munc13-1 is suggested to open a closed form of syntaxin-1 (53), which may be well suited for an active monomeric Munc13-1 protein.
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Despite divergent roles for dimerization in function, the mechanism of dimerization for CAPS and Munc13-1 may be similar. Munc13-1 C2A and CAPS C2 domains exhibit 41% amino acid sequence similarity, and neither is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding domain (50). Conserved residues in the CAPS C2 domain (Lys-428 and Asp-472) were identified based on the Munc13-1 C2A homodimer structure (38). Charge reversal mutations in these residues impaired CAPS dimerization and function, supporting the conclusion that dimerization mechanisms for CAPS and Munc13-1 are conserved.

27528604|t|Regulation of CAPS Dimer Formation and Function
27528604|a|

27528604|t|The binding of PI(4,5)P2 to CAPS markedly enhanced dimer formation (Fig. 3). Binding of PI(4,5)P2 to the PH domain of CAPS (25) may induce dimer formation by synergistic interactions within the central C2-PH region of CAPS (Fig. 6A). The PH domain is immediately adjacent to the C2 domain so that binding of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane could drive C2 domain-mediated dimerization. PH domains can also dimerize (54, 55), which could account for the incomplete loss of dimerization in CAPS(ΔC2). Dimerization of the PH domain in CAPS could increase the avidity for binding PI(4,5)P2, which would further stabilize dimers on the membrane. More C-terminal domains in dimerized CAPS such as MHD1 might in turn exhibit multivalent interactions with SNARE proteins to promote the assembly of dimers of SNARE complexes, as observed on liposomes (30). Thus, the unique central C2-PH domain of CAPS could serve as an important PI(4,5)P2-dependent switch for the activation of CAPS as a dimer on membrane. This model would account for the essential roles for PI(4,5)P2 binding and dimerization in CAPS function.

For the ΔC2-CAPS, overlap extension PCR was used to delete amino acids 400–516 from the CAPS ORF. This allowed residue 399 to be directly fused to residue 517 without introduction of a restriction site. Primers used were f1 (CCAGGACCGATTCCAGGCTTTCCTCAATGG, f2 (TCCTTCTCCTTGGAGCAAAACATGAAGCACTCTGG), r1 (AGAGTGCTTCATGTTTTGCTCCAAGGAGAAGGACAG), and r2 (CCTGAAATGTGTAATTTGATTTTCCAGCAGAACTCGG). CAPS-mKATE2-His constructs were created by cutting CAPS-Myc-His from pcDNA3.1 with XhoI and AfeI and ligating into a similarly cut mKate2-C (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) appended with a C-terminal His purification tag. All constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

27528604|t|Analytical Ultracentrifugation
27528604|a|

27528604|t|Three different CAPS concentrations (0.2–8.4 μm) were analyzed. ∼100 μl of each sample was loaded into sectors of 1.2-cm charcoal-filled epon centerpieces with ∼110 μl of the final dialysate buffer in the reference sector. Data were collected at 4 °C with the gradients monitored at 279 nm. From the CAPS sequence, the partial specific volume was 0.733 ml/g and is uncorrected for temperature. The buffer composition was 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. The density at 4 °C was 1.0044 g/ml, as calculated from density increments (Laue diffraction) and corrected to 4 (no increment was available for HEPES, and its contribution was neglected). CAPS molecular mass was computed as 150,613. An extinction coefficient of 138,660/m/cm was used based on Pace's average extinction (58) and does not include the disulfide bonds. Equilibrium data were collected at 3600, 6000, and 8800 rpm. Equilibrium was assumed when gradients collected ≥3 h apart were superimposable. After a high speed spin for a few hours depleted all protein material, the remaining absorbance in the low field region was taken as a measure of non-sedimentable absorbance, which was <0.01 and treated as fixed during various model fittings. The range of absorbance in the data included in the analysis ranged from 0.03 to 1.4 (at 1.2-cm path length) or a concentration of 0.2–8.4 μm. For data shown (Fig. 1D), the three lines for each color represent different rotor speeds for the high (green), medium (blue), and low (red) loading concentration.

27528604|t|CAPS was imaged by adding 100 pm CAPS to freshly cleaved mica disks and allowed to dry or imaged submerged with SLBs at 10 nm. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate) (PI(4,5)P2), obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) as chloroform stocks, were mixed at molar ratios of 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine or 75% phosphatidylcholine, 22% phosphatidylserine, 3% PI(4,5)P2. Chloroform was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were rehydrated overnight in water (MilliQ) at a lipid concentration of 2 mg/ml. The lipid suspension was incubated at 65 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. CAPS, NaCl, HEPES-NaOH, and CaCl2 were added to produce a liposome suspension containing 10 nm CAPS in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) and 1 mm CaCl2. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then deposited onto freshly cleaved mica disks (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK). After a 3-min adsorption, the sample was rinsed with HBS containing CaCl2 to remove unadsorbed liposomes and transferred to the atomic force microscope. AFM imaging was carried out at room temperature using a Bruker Multimode atomic force microscope equipped with an E-scanner and a Nanoscope IIIa controller, with an in-line electronics extender module (Bruker, Coventry, UK). All images were collected using tapping mode in fluid with Micromasch AFM cantilevers NSC18/AL BS MikroMasch® (Innovative Solutions Bulgaria Ltd., Sofia, Bulgaria). The cantilevers (typically exhibiting a spring constant of 2.8 newtons/m) were tuned to 10–20% below the peak of the resonance frequency, generally between 25 and 35 kHz. The drive amplitude was set to generate a root mean square amplitude of 2 V. The microscope was engaged with a 0-nm scan area to allow for tuning. The set point was applied to the sample. Images (2 × 2 μm) were captured at a scan rate of 2 Hz and with 512 scan lines/area. Data analysis was performed using commercially available software (NanoScope III, Digital Instruments) or with ImageJ. Multiple images were taken from one supported lipid bilayer for each condition.

27528604|a|

27528604|t|Single molecules of CAPS-mKate2-His, mKate2-His, or the dimeric (mKate2)2-His were immobilized on glass by SiMPull (35). Briefly, an imaging chamber was created by sandwiching 24 × 60-mm number 1.5 and 22 × 60-mm number 1.5 glass slides between lines of high vacuum grease to create 4–5 channels with a volume between 20 and 50 μl. Chambers were rinsed with 10 chamber volumes of buffer (25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4) to remove dust and a BSA/antibody solution (FC protein (10 mg/ml), monoclonal His tag antibody (Penta-His (Qiagen)) concentration of 0.1 mg/ml), incubated for 10 min, and flushed with 5 chamber volumes of buffer, and 50 pm CAPS-mKate2-His was added to the chamber; protein was diluted in prelubricated 1.7-ml Eppendorf tubes to minimize nonspecific absorption to the plastic surface (Costar, catalog no. 3207). Alternatively, CAPS-mKate2-His was immobilized on 5% PI(4,5)P2-containing SLBs. CAPS-mKate2 lacking the His tag was prepared by cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and similarly bound to SLBs. Unbound protein was removed with 5 chamber volumes of buffer, and the bound protein was imaged by TIRF microscopy on a TE2000 inverted scope (Nikon) stationed on a floating table. A 514-nm laser line excited the fluorophore and was imaged with an Evolve digital monochrome EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). 500-frame movies with a capture rate of 2 Hz were recorded. Movies were drift-corrected using the ImageJ plugin Descriptor-based registration (2d/3d +t); movies with significant drift were discarded. Movies were processed via a Matlab script generously provided by Dr. Aaron Hoskins (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Photobleaching steps were manually recorded if a spot maintained uniform fluorescence before photobleaching, did not display x,y-drift, and underwent photobleaching in one frame.

27528604|a|

27528604|t|Proteoliposomes were prepared by co-micellization as described previously (23). Briefly, syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm IDA, 1% β-octyl glucoside was used to resuspend a dried film of 2.5 mm lipid of DOPC, 5% PI(4,5)P2. After resuspension, mixtures were rapidly diluted into 25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4; dialyzed overnight into 25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4, with 1 g/liter Biobeads; and purified on an Accudenz medium (Accurate Chemical Corp., Westbury, NY) gradient. Liposomes were made identically with the omission of the SNARE proteins. The addition of 3H-labeled 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine to liposomes was used to monitor lipid recovery, and SDS-PAGE densitometry of the Q-SNAREs was used to assess protein content. 1 μm CAPS-Myc-His was incubated with Q-SNARE proteoliposomes for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were mixed 1:1 with 80% Accudenz and pipetted into a thin walled polycarbonate tube, overlaid with 30% Accudenz and a 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4, layer for centrifugation (45000 rpm, SW50 swinging bucket rotor). Floated fractions were withdrawn and analyzed by either blue native or SDS-PAGE. For blue native analysis where indicated, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5% for several minutes followed by 2× blue native PAGE buffer (0.25% Coomassie G250, 75 mm BisTris, 10% glycerol, 1.5 m 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) for 5 min.

27528604|t|PC12 cells were transfected with an Electroporator II instrument (Invitrogen) and plated on glass coverslips, and 48 h later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde plus PBS for 20 min at room temperature. For immunostaining, fixed cells were extracted in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked for 30 min in 10% BSA plus PBS. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed, and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. After washes in PBS, cells were mounted and imaged on a Nikon C1 confocal microscope (TE2000-U). Primary antibodies used were chromogranin B monoclonal generously provided by W. B. Huttner (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany), TGN38 monoclonal generously provided by K. E. Howell (University of Colorado, Denver, CO), syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody (catalog no. 610636, BD Biosciences), and synaptotagmin-1 N-terminal polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). For electron microscopy, PC12 cells were transfected with pCMV CAPS-GFP or CAPS(G476E)-GFP for 48 h, sorted by FACS on a SORP BD FACSAria (University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Laboratory) to remove untransfected cells, and fixed. Cells on glass coverslips were fixed in a solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, for ∼1 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed 5 times for 5 min in 0.1 m PB. The rinsed cultures were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, 1% potassium ferrocyanide in PB for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were rinsed in PB followed by distilled water rinses three times for 5 min each to clear phosphates. Samples were en bloc stained in saturated aqueous uranyl acetate for 2 h at room temperature and rinsed in distilled water three times for 5 min each. Dehydration was performed at room temperature in a graded ethanol series (35, 50, 70, 80, and 90% for 5 min, 95% for 10 min, 100% three times for 10 min) and transitioned in propylene oxide two times for 7 min each. Durcupan ACM (Fluka AG, Buchs, Switzerland) resin was used during infiltration and embedding. Increasing concentrations of accelerated (10 ml of A/M, 10 ml of B, 300 μl of C, 100 μl of D components) Durcupan were used for infiltration. All infiltration steps were done with the coverslips, cell side up, in aluminum weighing dishes in covered glass Petri dishes to minimize evaporation. The cultures were embedded in open aluminum weighing dishes at 60 °C in a drying oven overnight until polymerized. Samples were floated in concentrated hydrofluoric acid, glass side down, for 15 min to etch off the glass, revealing the embedded cells. Sections were viewed with a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope, and images were documented with a MegaView III (Olympus-SIS, Lakewood, CO) side-mounted digital camera.

27528604|t|Sequence Alignments
27528604|a|

27528604|t|We used the C2 domain conserved protein domain family (CD00030) as a seed for C2 domain alignments. It is produced by an automated algorithm, which employs generic search parameters that invariably contain omissions and misalignments that require refinement. Only 32 of 97 C2 domain structures represented in the C2 domain PFAM (PF00168) were included (at the time of submission, this PFAM has 105 structures). The missing structures were imported into Cn3D and aligned with the provided block alignment algorithm. The sequence alignment of every structure was manually refined by assessing the resulting spatial overlap between the C2 domain in question with all other C2 structures. After assessing every β strand for all structures, we were able to create a sequence alignment for all C2 domain structures that is based on a high degree of spatial overlap between all C2 domain residues. The aligned residues represent the core C2 domain residues that have an invariant spatial positioning between these 97 crystal structures. Using these core C2 residues as a search query, DALI identified all other C2 domain structures in the C2 PFAM, yielding an average root mean square deviation of 1 Å that accounts for 100 of the residues tested for spatial overlap. It is common to observe backbone atoms of two aligned C2 domains in these conserved regions with distances between 0.4 and 0.6 Å, less than that of an H–H bond.

27904735|t|Background
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is still diagnosed through behavioral observation, due to a lack of laboratory biomarkers, which could greatly aid clinicians in providing earlier and more reliable diagnoses. Metabolomics on human biofluids provides a sensitive tool to identify metabolite profiles potentially usable as biomarkers for ASD. Initial metabolomic studies, analyzing urines and plasma of ASD and control individuals, suggested that autistic patients may share some metabolic abnormalities, despite several inconsistencies stemming from differences in technology, ethnicity, age range, and definition of “control” status.
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Methods
27904735|a|

27904735|t|ASD-specific urinary metabolomic patterns were explored at an early age in 30 ASD children and 30 matched controls (age range 2–7, M:F = 22:8) using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-UHPLC and mass spectrometry, a highly sensitive, accurate, and unbiased approach. Metabolites were then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and grouped by metabolic pathway.
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Results
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Urinary metabolites displaying the largest differences between young ASD and control children belonged to the tryptophan and purine metabolic pathways. Also, vitamin B6, riboflavin, phenylalanine-tyrosine-tryptophan biosynthesis, pantothenate and CoA, and pyrimidine metabolism differed significantly. ASD children preferentially transform tryptophan into xanthurenic acid and quinolinic acid (two catabolites of the kynurenine pathway), at the expense of kynurenic acid and especially of melatonin. Also, the gut microbiome contributes to altered tryptophan metabolism, yielding increased levels of indolyl 3-acetic acid and indolyl lactate.

27904735|t|Conclusions
27904735|a|

27904735|t|The metabolic pathways most distinctive of young Italian autistic children largely overlap with those found in rodent models of ASD following maternal immune activation or genetic manipulations. These results are consistent with the proposal of a purine-driven cell danger response, accompanied by overproduction of epileptogenic and excitotoxic quinolinic acid, large reductions in melatonin synthesis, and gut dysbiosis. These metabolic abnormalities could underlie several comorbidities frequently associated to ASD, such as seizures, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and could contribute to autism severity. Their diagnostic sensitivity, disease-specificity, and interethnic variability will merit further investigation.

27904735|t|Background
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a highly heterogeneous collection of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social and communication deficits, stereotypic and rigid patterns of behavior, restricted interests, and unusual sensory processing with onset in early childhood [1]. The prevalence of autism has increased significantly during the last two decades from 2–5/10,000 to 1:68 children [2, 3]. Changes in diagnostic criteria and increased attention by the medical community have certainly contributed to this trend [4]. Also, increasing parental age at conception has been shown to confer ASD risk [5], as well as some environmental factors, active especially during critical periods in prenatal/early postnatal neurodevelopment [6]. Finally, genetic susceptibility plays a prominent role in ASD pathogenesis through complex and heterogeneous underpinnings, ranging from rare variants endowed with full penetrance to common variants each explaining very small proportions of the overall phenotypic variance, either alone or through gene × environment interactions [7, 8].
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Despite major advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ASD, this level of complexity and interindividual heterogeneity has largely hampered the translation of scientific knowledge into more effective clinical practices. ASD is still diagnosed exclusively through observation, standardized behavioral scales, and parental interviews; developmental trajectories of ASD children are periodically monitored but cannot be reliably predicted especially at an early age. Sensitive and specific quantitative biomarkers, measurable through laboratory, brain imaging, and/or electrophysiological techniques, could greatly aid clinicians in providing earlier diagnoses, more timely referrals to behavioral intervention programs, and evidence-based prognostic predictions [9].
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Metabolomic technologies offer a sensitive means to search human biofluids for metabolite profiles potentially usable as biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders. A few studies have recently begun exploring the potential of urinary metabolomics in identifying ASD-specific metabolic patterns or in stratifying ASD patients into pathophysiologically meaningful subgroups [10–17]. Most studies have been performed on urines [10–16]; one study has explored blood plasma [17]. The analytical platforms most commonly used to identify and quantify metabolites are gas or liquid chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectroscopy (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS, respectively) [12, 16] and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19]. In general, NMR displays greater speed and good reproducibility but also lower sensitivity compared to MS. Hence, MS- and NMR-based techniques should be viewed as complementary, not as superimposable approaches. An initial study, using 1H-NMR methods, showed an abnormal composition of urinary solutes indicative of perturbations in (a) the tryptophan/nicotinic acid metabolic pathway, (b) sulfur and amino acid metabolisms, and (c) gut microbiome, with an excess of several gut-derived co-metabolites [10]. Two other studies presumably assessing the same clinical sample with two different NMR-based technologies largely replicated these initial findings [13, 14]. Other studies using GC-MS, either alone [12, 15] or in combination with liquid chromatography [11], also identified perturbations in amino acid metabolism and gut microbial co-metabolites, as well as metabolic signatures of oxidative stress. Only one very recent study used both NMR and LC-MS, providing support for abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism, gut bacterial-derived compounds, purine and pyrimidine metabolism [16]. The only study exploring blood plasma reported metabolomic patterns compatible with (a) mitochondrial dysfunction, yielding reduced energy production and unbalanced redox status, (b) excess gut microbial co-metabolites, and (c) unbalances in various metabolic pathways, such as the Krebs cycle [17]. Collectively, metabolomic studies performed to this date suggest that autistic patients may share several metabolic abnormalities, especially involving some amino acid metabolisms, energy production, and oxidative stress, as well as the gut microbiome.

27904735|t|Moving from broad metabolic pathways to single compounds unveils inconsistencies between studies, which may stem from several potential confounds. Interethnic differences in the gut microbiota, stemming from differences in the nutrient composition of local diets, as well as age-related changes in both gut microbiota and human metabolism indeed require that case and control samples be tightly matched for these two variables. Age-related changes may be especially relevant to studies of ASD, where we have recently reported levels of urinary p-cresol to be elevated in autistic children compared to age-matched controls both in Italy and in France, but exclusively up until 8 years of age [20, 21]. Similar age-related changes in ASD have been previously described for other parameters, such as brain serotonin synthesis capacity [22, 23] and excessive head growth rates [24]. Finally, some studies have contrasted ASD patients with unrelated population controls [11, 14, 16, 17], while others have enrolled unaffected siblings as controls [15] and one study has used both [10]. These strategies are not equivalent, as first-degree relatives often fall within the broad autism spectrum (i.e., they display behavioral phenotypes intermediate between patients and population controls) [25]. In addition, siblings may carry protective gene variants with peculiar functional correlates, possibly distinct from the metabolic patterns of unrelated typically developing children.

27904735|t|Taking into consideration these methodological issues, in order to maximize the probability of reliably detecting differences in urinary metabolic patterns, we focused on autistic and unrelated typically developing children 2–8 years old, tightly matched by age, sex, Italian ancestry, and city of origin within the country [20]. To ensure broad metabolite detection coverage on urine samples, which comprise molecules generated both by human cells and by the gut microbiome, we employed hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS, a technology particularly suitable to separate simple and complex mixtures of carbohydrates, amino acids, glycosides, and other natural polar products in biological fluids, such as human urine and plasma [26, 27]. Applying this experimental approach, urinary metabolites most significantly distinguishing autistic from typically developing children were found to primarily fall into the tryptophan and purine metabolic pathways.

27904735|a|

27904735|t|Thirty children with idiopathic ASD and thirty typically developing controls were recruited in Central and Northern Italy. These represent the vast majority of the 64 cases and controls aged 3–7 years assessed for urinary p-cresol in our previous study [20]. Their demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1. Diagnostic assessments and medical screening have been previously described [20] (also see Additional file 2 with Supplementary Methods). Tight sex- and age-matching (±1 year) was applied to recruit typically developing children devoid of any overt ASD symptomatology among the offspring of clinical/academic personnel [20]. Mean age (±SEM) of cases and controls was 4.83 ± 0.30 and 5.03 ± 0.32 years, respectively (Student’s t = −0.459, 58 df, P = 0.648, n.s.), and the M:F ratio was 22:8. All cases and controls were of Italian descent and matched by geographical area or city of origin.

A Phenomenex Luna 3 μm HILIC 200 A (150 × 2.0 mm) column, protected by a HILIC 4 × 2.0 mm ID guard column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), was used to perform metabolite separation over a phase B-to-phase A gradient lasting 35 min. For the HILIC separation, mobile phase “A” consisted in 50 mM ammonium acetate mixed with acetonitrile (95:5, v/v), while eluent “B” was composed of a mixture of 50 mM ammonium acetate:water plus acetonitrile (95:5, v/v). Acetonitrile, formic acid, and HPLC-grade water were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

27904735|a|

27904735|t|Data were normalized by urinary specific gravity, because creatinine excretion may be abnormally reduced in ASD children [30]. Replicates were exported as mzXML files and processed through MAVEN.52 (available at http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/mzroll/index.php?show=index) [31]. Mass spectrometry chromatograms were elaborated for peak alignment, matching and comparison of parent and fragment ions, and tentative metabolite identification (within a 10-ppm mass deviation range between observed and expected results against the imported Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database). Representative examples of mass determination and MS/MS fragmentation graphs are presented for kynurenine, melatonin, and tryptophan in Additional file 3: Figure S1. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the entire metabolomics data set using the MetaboAnalyst 3.0 software (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca) [32], which also overviewed data variance structure in an unsupervised manner and produced scatter plots.

27904735|t|Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), which defines a predictive model that describes the direction of the maximum covariance between a dataset (X) and class membership (Y), was then used to maximize the difference in metabolic profiles between cases and controls [33, 34]. OPLS-DA was performed using the Excel add-in Multibase package (Numerical Dynamics, Japan; http://www.numericaldynamics.com/) by applying orthogonal signal correction on the metabolite concentrations shifted, log10 transformed, centered, and scaled to unit variance.

27904735|t|For case-control contrasts of single urinary metabolites, significance threshold was held at a nominal P < 0.05 with no correction for multiple testing, because (a) differences in single metabolite concentrations were tested only following significant differences in pathway enrichment were detected, (b) intra-pathway variability of single metabolites is non-independent, and (c) also different metabolic pathways are not fully independent, as some metabolites fall into more than one pathway. Detailed and summary statistics are provided in Additional files 4 and 5.

Approximately 10,000 peaks per sample were obtained referring to the KEGG database; among them, 202 metabolites were analyzed more precisely and identified. The top 25 most discriminating metabolites between cases and controls were further defined based on “variable influence on the projection” (VIP) scores >1 (Fig. 2). ROC analysis using this set of 25 metabolites yielded an AUC = 0.893 (95% CI 0.72–0.96), as shown in Additional file 7. The “metabolome overview” obtained through metabolic pathway analysis (MetPA) shows tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, and phenylalanine-tyrosine-tryptophan biosynthesis as the four most perturbed metabolic pathways in ASD (Fig. 3).

27904735|t|Discussion
27904735|a|

27904735|t|The present study reports significant urinary metabolomic differences between young children with idiopathic ASD and typically developing controls. At least some of the metabolic perturbations described here may reflect pathophysiologically meaningful abnormalities, possibly bearing functional consequences at the clinical level. Three strengths of the experimental design may have contributed to this positive outcome: (a) a focus on early infancy, by recruiting children within a relatively narrow age window precisely defined on the basis of previous urinary metabolic data [20, 21]; (b) the use of UHPLC-MS paired with HILIC, a very sensitive and reliable method ensuring maximum accuracy in the separation of small urinary solutes [26, 27]; (b) a pathway-centered approach, moving beyond the identification of single urinary ASD markers [10–17], as beautifully exemplified by urinary metabolomic studies of rodent models of ASD [35–37]. In particular, our recruitment strategy substantially differs from previous case-control study designs, minimizing age-dependent heterogeneity by setting data-driven age thresholds (i.e., 2–8 years old) [20, 21], and applying tight age and sex matching between cases and controls. This strategy seemingly circumvents sample size limitations which would apply to an unfocused and unmatched case-control design. Future replications obtained applying similar recruitment criteria will enhance confidence in the pathophysiological relevance and the interethnic generalizability of our findings.
27904735|a|

27904735|t|The tryptophan metabolic pathway collectively displays the largest perturbations in ASD (Fig. 3). Over 90–95% of dietary l-tryptophan is usually metabolized along the kynurenine pathway, 1–2% is converted to serotonin, and approximately 4–6% undergoes bacterial degradation prior to gut absorption through the Na+-amino acid co-transporter B0AT1 (Slc6a19) [38, 39]. The latter pathway yields indole derivatives not produced by mammalian metabolism, such as indoxyl sulfate [40]. Hence, changes in urinary amounts of multiple metabolites provide more reliable evidence of perturbed tryptophan metabolism, as compared to determinations of single metabolites or tryptophan itself, which also suffer from reduced statistical power due to control for multiple testing (Figs. 4 and 5). In the urines of young autistic children, we have indeed observed a substantial increase of xanthurenic acid and especially of quinolinic acid, paralleled by a decrease in kynurenine and kynurenic acid (Fig. 4, path A). This pattern is extremely interesting but must be interpreted with some caution in the absence of parallel assessments of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). On the one hand, the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of quinolinic acid and xanthurenic acid are primarily expressed in the microglia and in macrophages, whereas the path leading to kynurenic acid is functional in astrocytes [41]. Hence, it would be tempting to speculate that these opposite trends between cases and controls reflect an abnormal activation of microglia, which has been repeatedly seen in ASD postmortem brains [42–44], even as early as at 4 years of age [45]. On the other hand, urinary levels of quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid reflect peripheral production of these compounds, which do not pass the blood-brain barrier [41]. However, 3-hydroxykynurenine does pass the blood-brain barrier [41]. Interestingly, urinary concentrations of metabolite downstream of this compound (quinolinic acid and xanthurenic acid) are elevated in autistic children, whereas metabolite upstream of 3-hydroxykinurenine (kynurenine and kynurenic acid) are higher among controls (Fig. 4, path A). Conceivably, these trends could reflect an outflow of 3-hydroxykynurenine from the central nervous system (CNS) into the systemic circulation, where macrophage activation presumably at the level of the gut or in other peripheral organs, can transform this compound into quinolinic acid and xanthurenic acid, as well as into nicotinic acid (NAD), in agreement with previous data [10]. It will thus be important to verify this metabolomic scenario in the CSF, because it could have at least two important clinical implications: (a) quinolinic acid acts as gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, and pro-oxidant molecule, boosting oxidative stress by stimulating microglia to release large amounts of NO and superoxide; (b) quinolinic acid exerts excitotoxic effects by acting as an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, stimulating glutamate release, blocking glutamate reuptake into astrocytes, and reducing the activity of glutamine synthase; instead, kynurenic acid exerts neuroprotection via NMDA antagonism at the glycine binding site, as well as antioxidant effects [41, 46, 47]. In summary, the urinary metabolic imbalance documented here, if present also in the CNS, could favor enhanced oxidative stress and the well-known excitation>inhibition imbalance present in ASD, fostering seizures in as many as 20% of autistic individuals [48].

27904735|t|Another consequence of the preferential metabolization of tryptophan along the main branch of the kynurenine pathway is the relative decrease in the production of serotonin and melatonin (Fig. 4, path B). The serotonin pathway sees tryptophan being converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by tryptophan hydroxylase and onwards to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin by 5-HTP decarboxylase. Serotonin can then be catabolized to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) or transformed into N-acetylserotonin by arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). N-acetylserotonin is further methylated by N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to generate the neurohormone 5-methyl-5-methoxy-N-tryptamine or melatonin. Decreases in the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA are only modest, while urinary melatonin and its catabolite N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine display a more pronounced mean reduction (both share the same molecular weight and fall under the same MS peak, labeled in Fig. 4, path B, as “melatonin” only). This confirms previous assessments performed in plasma or urine [10, 49–52], while lending further support to blunted melatonin synthesis possibly due to reduced ASMT enzyme activity in ASD [53, 54]. Melatonin is synthesized and released by the pineal gland into the systemic circulation and readily passes the blood-brain barrier [55]. Its well-known role in circadian rhythmicity makes it an ideal candidate to explain the frequent occurrence, especially at the onset of ASD and during early infancy, of sleep disorders highly responsive to melatonin as a pharmacological therapy [56].

27904735|t|Metabolites produced by gut bacteria are well-represented also in our ASD sample, as in previous studies [10–17]. In addition to urinary p-cresol, found elevated in these same urine samples both here (Fig. 3) and previously using a different technology [20], we also detect a significant increase in indole derivatives of bacterial tryptophan including indolyl 3-acetic acid, indoxyl sulfate, and most prominently, indolyl lactate (Fig. 4, path C). Bacterial species expressing tryptophanase, the enzyme responsible for transforming tryptophan into indole derivatives, include Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Paracolobactrum coliform, Achromobacter liquefaciens, and Bacteroides spp. [40]. Once produced in the gut lumen, indole is absorbed, oxidized to indoxyl, conjugated with sulfate, and excreted as urinary indoxyl sulfate. About 3% of tryptophan entered with the diet is excreted as indoxyl sulfate [37]. Additional small amounts of tryptophan are converted into other indole derivatives found elevated here in ASD children, such as indolyl-3-acetic acid and indolyl lactate (Fig. 4, path C). The latter compound and indolyl 3-acetic acid are direct precursors of indolylacrylol glycine, found elevated in ASD by some [57] but not all studies [58, 59]. Predictably, the exact urinary bacterial compounds found elevated in ASD do differ in distinct metabolomic studies. This is not surprising since, in addition to differences in sample demographics and sensitivity of available technologies, ethnicity also exerts profound influences on the microbiome, reflecting dietary, genetic, and immunological specificities involved in the host-microbiome interactions [60]. Despite these discrepancies at the level of single compounds, urinary metabolomic studies consistently report an excess of microbiome-derived urinary metabolites, collectively supporting gut dysbiosis in ASD. These results point toward possible negative effects on CNS function exerted by microbiome-derived metabolites. At least three examples are available, albeit with different degrees of support: (a) urinary p-cresol amounts were found correlated with ASD severity [20] or with the intensity of stereotypic behaviors in young autistic children [21]; (b) i.c.v. injection of propionic acid, an enteric-derived short chain fatty acid, produces ASD-like behaviors in the rat [61]; (c) indoxyl sulfate is a known risk factor for cognitive impairment in chronic renal disease [62]: its influx across the blood-brain barrier using the organic anion transporter 3 significantly reduces the efflux of various neurotransmitter metabolites through the same transporter, leading to their accumulation [63]. Importantly, sizable improvements in behavioral and serum metabolome abnormalities were recorded using the maternal immune activation (MIA) rodent model of ASD following the correction of gut dysbiosis using Bacteroides fragilis [64].

27904735|t|Purine metabolites are also well represented in the urines of ASD children, which display a large excess of inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthosine (Figs. 3 and 5). This pattern bears an interesting resemblance to the excess of urinary inosine and hypoxanthine detected in Fmr1 knock-out mice, an animal model of fragile-X syndrome [35]. Also, mice exposed prenatally to MIA triggered by poly(I:C) injected at E12.5 and E17.5 show an excess of urinary inosine [36]. This excess of urinary purinergic metabolites has been interpreted as part of a “cell danger metabolic response” involving mitochondrial dysfunction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) release, activation of a variety of purinergic receptors yielding microglial activation, innate, and adaptive immunity responses and leukocyte chemotactics [65]. Inborn errors of purine metabolism are associated with behavioral abnormalities including autistic features [66]. Strikingly, inhibition of purine metabolism by suramin, a competitive antagonist at P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors, reverses behavioral, neurochemical, transcriptional, and metabolomics abnormalities both in the Fmr1 knock-out mouse and in MIA mice exposed to poly(I:C) during pregnancy [35–37]. Conceivably, this metabolic abnormality, shared between human ASD and genetic/immunological rodent models could thus represent a valuable biomarker to help guide therapeutic interventions. In addition, the cell danger response also yields relative vitamin B6 deficiency and the enzyme kynureninase is B6 dependent [65]; hence, a cell danger metabolic response in the presence of adequate tryptophan intake could also explain the decreased kynurenine and increased xanthurenic and quinolinic acid observed here (Fig. 4). Interestingly, these abnormalities have been sometimes overcome with vitamin B6 supplementation [67], a therapeutic approach initially proposed for ASD in conjunction with magnesium supplementation [68]. In light of the present data, B6-Mg++ supplementation in ASD may deserve further scrutiny in urinary biomarker-driven therapeutic trials, as no firm conclusion on its potential efficacy has yet been reached [69].

27904735|t|Conclusions
27904735|a|

27904735|t|Targeting young autistic children and tightly matched controls, using the sensitive approach HILIC UHPLC-MS, and applying metabolic pathway analysis, we identified several urinary metabolic pathways significantly altered in ASD: tryptophan, purine, and vitamin B6 metabolisms; phenylalanine, and tyrosine biosynthesis; and to a lesser extent, pantothenate and CoA, riboflavin, and pyrimidine metabolisms. Several of these same pathways, especially tryptophan, purine, and gut microbiome metabolisms, are also abnormal in animal models of ASD and provide very interesting leads toward possible pathophysiological explanations for specific symptoms present in many autistic children, such as seizures and sleep disorders. These metabolic abnormalities may apply to young children only, as suggested by studies of urinary p-cresol [20, 21]. It will indeed be very important to now perform a similar metabolomic assessment on ASD individuals and controls older than 8 years of age. Investigations of CSF metabolomics will be necessary to verify to what extent peripheral results reflect CNS pathophysiology. Finally, studies involving other diagnostic groups bordering with ASD, such as ADHD, intellectual disability, expressive language disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, will be required to assess the disease specificity of the metabolomic abnormalities reported here and to determine their potential value as ASD-specific biomarkers, possibly able to aid clinicians in providing more reliable diagnoses in early infancy.

27823936|t|MyoD phosphorylation on multiple C terminal sites regulates myogenic conversion activity
27823936|a|

27823936|t|MyoD is a master regulator of myogenesis with a potent ability to redirect the cell fate of even terminally differentiated cells. Hence, enhancing the activity of MyoD is an important step to maximising its potential utility for in vitro disease modelling and cell replacement therapies. We have previously shown that the reprogramming activity of several neurogenic bHLH proteins can be substantially enhanced by inhibiting their multi-site phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases. Here we have used Xenopus embryos as an in vivo developmental and reprogramming system to investigate the multi-site phospho-regulation of MyoD during muscle differentiation. We show that, in addition to modification of a previously well-characterised site, Serine 200, MyoD is phosphorylated on multiple additional serine/threonine sites during primary myogenesis. Through mutational analysis, we derive an optimally active phospho-mutant form of MyoD that has a dramatically enhanced ability to drive myogenic reprogramming in vivo. Mechanistically, this is achieved through increased protein stability and enhanced chromatin association. Therefore, multi-site phospho-regulation of class II bHLH proteins is conserved across cell lineages and germ layers, and manipulation of phosphorylation of these key regulators may have further potential for enhancing mammalian cell reprogramming.

27823936|t|Introduction
27823936|a|

27823936|t|The basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein MyoD is an extensively studied Muscle Regulatory Factor (MRF) that plays a pivotal role during muscle development, and has also received much attention for its ability to direct a myogenic program even in terminally differentiated somatic cells [1], [2]. Using MyoD to direct trans-differentiation has potential utility in cellular reprogramming efforts directed at in vitro modelling of muscle diseases for drug screening [3] and in cell replacement therapies [4]. However, refining of these reprogramming methods requires optimising the myogenic activity of MyoD.
27823936|a|

27823936|t|We have previously studied other master regulatory proneural bHLH transcription factors that drive differentiation in the neural lineage, namely Neurogenin2, Ascl1 and NeuroD4 [5], [6], [7], [8]. We see that phosphorylation of these factors on multiple serine-proline and threonine-proline (SP and TP) sites suppressed both their ability to drive neuronal differentiation during development [5], [7] and during cellular reprogramming of mammalian cells [6].

27823936|t|MyoD phosphorylation on Serine 200 (S200) and S5, sites both found as part of an SP motif, has long been recognised to underlie the characteristic MyoD protein fluctuations and activity that vary with cell cycle phase in proliferating myoblasts [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. MyoD also contains multiple additional SP and TP sites which may, by analogy with proneural factors, play an additional role in regulation of the ability of MyoD to promote myogenic conversion and differentiation. Here, using the Xenopus tadpole as a model to test MyoD's myogenic conversion potential, we show that myogenic activity of MyoD is regulated by up to five S/TP kinase sites specifically located in the C terminus of the protein. Furthermore, we see that multi-site phosphorylation regulates both MyoD protein stability and chromatin association. Finally, we identify an optimal phospho-mutant form of MyoD that dramatically enhances myogenic conversion of embryonic ectoderm in vivo.

Mean values and the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) were calculated from at least three independent experiments (n = 3). Statistical significance was determined using a paired two-tailed Student's t-test with (p < 0.05) = *; (p < 0.025) = **; (p < 0.0125) = ***. For in situ hybridisation data, experiments were conducted in independent duplicate or triplicate and the n numbers reported refer to the range of total numbers of embryos in each injection category.

27823936|a|
27823936	47	48	S	Chemical	MESH:D012694

27823936|t|Early studies investigating phospho-regulation of MyoD largely focused on its modification in proliferating cells in culture; either C2C12 myoblasts or C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts transfected with MyoD [10], [12]. To investigate phosphorylation of MyoD and its reprogramming activity in vivo, we chose the highly versatile Xenopus embryo system, which can be used to study mammalian MyoD activity both in the endogenous myotome and also for reprogramming activity in the non-myogenic ectoderm tissue [14]. Furthermore, the first cleavage of the fertilised egg bisects the embryos into future left and right sides, so unilateral mRNA injection allows MyoD activity to be directly compared between injected and uninjected embryo sides.
27823936|a|

27823936|t|Firstly, we explored whether MyoD is phosphorylated during primary myogenesis. Extracts were prepared from stage 12.5 embryos injected with mRNA encoding HA-tagged Wild-Type (WT) MyoD, or S200A MyoD, a mutant version with S200 mutated to alanine to prevent phosphorylation at this established site. Western blot analysis reveals a broad protein band for both WT and S200A proteins (Fig. 1A), with more S200A protein than WT, consistent with previous reports that demonstrate a longer half-life for this mutant protein [10], [11], [12]. Incubation with a broad spectrum protein phosphatase enhances the migration of both WT and S200A, indicating phosphorylation on at least one additional site during differentiation in vivo.

27823936|t|A multi-site phospho-mutant MyoD promotes enhanced myogenesis in vivo
27823936|a|

27823936|t|Mouse MyoD protein contains seven potential proline-directed kinase sites (six serine-proline (SP), and one threonine-proline (TP)) that are highly conserved with human MyoD (Supplementary Fig. 1). To further explore a potential regulatory role of S/TP sites additional to S200 during myogenesis, a panel of phospho-mutant forms of MyoD were created (Fig. 1B): 7T/S-A MyoD contains all seven SP/TP sites mutated to alanine-proline (AP), while 6T/S-A(S200) has the S200 site restored but the remaining six sites mutated. In order to compare their myogenic activity, mRNA encoding these proteins was injected unilaterally into two-cell stage Xenopus embryos, and myogenesis was assayed in stage 18 embryos by RT-qPCR and in situ hybridisation (ISH) for muscle structural genes Myosin Heavy Chain or Muscle Actin respectively (Fig. 1C–E). At this level of over-expression, WT MyoD induces a small increase in myogenesis, largely confined to expansion of the myotome on the injected side. By comparison, both S200A and full phospho-mutant 7T/S-A induce a marked increase in myogenesis spreading laterally, and demonstrating reprogramming of ectoderm tissue. Interestingly, 6T/S-A(S200) also induces a significant increase in myogenesis relative to WT MyoD, albeit with less activity than S200A or 7T/S-A MyoDs. This demonstrates that sites in addition to S200 can regulate myogenic activity of MyoD.

27823936|t|Regulatory activity resides in C terminal phosphorylation sites
27823936|a|

27823936|t|We have previously described a model for phospho-regulation of proneural protein activity, where the number, rather than location of available phospho-sites is the key determinant of bHLH activity; mutation of increasing numbers of phosphorylation sites additively increases the neurogenic activity of the mutant proteins [5], [7]. To explore if a similar phenomenon may control regulation of MyoD, a panel of MyoD phospho-mutants were made with SP/TP sites cumulatively mutated from the N terminus to generate 1S-A, 2S-A etc (Fig. 2A). Due to the immediate proximity of T296/S298, these sites were mutated simultaneously.

27823936|t|Embryos were injected with mRNA as before and scored for myogenesis at stage 18 by ISH (Fig. 2B–C). Mutation of the N terminal SP sites in MyoD has no significant effect on its activity relative to the wild-type protein. Similarly, mutation of S200 in addition to the two N terminal sites (i.e. 3S-A) produces a level of myogenesis comparable to mutation of the single S200 site alone, suggesting that the N terminal sites do not contribute to regulation of MyoD myogenic activity. However, mutation of C terminal residues in addition to S200 results in a more active MyoD than the single phosphorylation site mutant S200A MyoD. Thus, for MyoD, both number and location of phospho-sites contribute to its regulation.

27823936|t|The five C terminal phospho-sites in mouse MyoD are also the phospho-sites that are most conserved with both human and Xenopus MyoD (Supplementary Fig. 1); S200 and S262 are highly conserved between all three species, suggesting that these may have enhanced functional significance. We therefore sought to address whether myogenic activity depends on any particular C terminal phospho-site.

27823936|t|Each C terminal site was mutated individually and myogenic activity was assayed as described above (Fig. 2D–E). Mutation of any individual C terminal phospho-site results in significantly enhanced myogenesis compared to WT MyoD. Furthermore, the three most C terminal sites when mutated individually (S262, S277 and T296/S298) are very similar to each other in inducing a moderate increase in myogenesis. By comparison, mutation of the S200 site alone results in myogenic activity that is significantly greater than any other single site mutant, yet this is still not as active as the full 7T/S-A phospho-mutant. Therefore, S200 confers the most significant regulatory activity but its mutation alone is not sufficient to maximally activate MyoD; additional C terminal residues must also be mutated.

27823936|t|Identification of an optimal phospho-mutant MyoD with maximal myogenic activity
27823936|a|

27823936|t|For the purposes of cellular reprogramming, an optimal form of MyoD would have maximal activity in driving myogenic conversion of non-muscle tissue. Therefore, we finally sought to derive an optimal phospho-mutant MyoD in our Xenopus assay. For the proneural proteins, maximal activity is achieved by mutation of all available phospho-sites [5], [6], [7], but for MyoD, we see that N terminal sites do not contribute to regulation (Fig. 2). S200 is the most important single C terminal site (Fig. 2), so additional constructs were made to mutate S200 in combination with other C terminal sites (data not shown). In all assays conducted, the most extensive myogenesis is induced by CT 5T/S-A MyoD, in which all five C terminal phospho-sites are mutated but the two N-terminal phospho-sites are intact. These results are summarised in Fig. 3, where NT 2S-A MyoD shows equivalent activity to WT protein, and CT 5T/S-A MyoD is more active than the full 7T/S-A phospho-mutant. We note that both of these multi-site mutants are significantly more active than the single S200A mutant, inducing extensive conversion of the lateral ectoderm to a myogenic cell fate, often seen bilaterally over the embryo. Thus, while S200 shows the greatest regulatory role of any individual site, phosphorylation must be prevented on all five C-terminal serine/threonines for maximal differentiation activity.

27823936|t|Having established an optimal phospho-mutant form of MyoD that has superior myogenic activity in vivo, we investigated the mechanisms by which this enhanced differentiation is achieved. One mechanism may be by enhancing MyoD protein stability. We have already shown that injection of equal amounts of WT and S200A MyoD mRNA produces a greater accumulation of S200A protein relative to WT MyoD (Fig. 1) so we next determined whether the optimal phospho-mutant CT 5T/S-A MyoD showed further enhancement of stability. HA-tagged mRNA was injected into Xenopus embryos, and protein extracts were prepared at stage 12.5 for western blot analysis; the density of each MyoD protein band was calculated relative to the respective tubulin loading control (Fig. 4A, C). While injection of the same amount of mRNA results in an almost three-fold increase in S200A protein relative to WT MyoD, CT 5T/S-A MyoD protein accumulates to a level that is more than four-fold higher than WT MyoD. Thus, whilst S200 is an established phospho-site that regulates MyoD stability [10], [12], further enhancement of MyoD protein stability accompanies mutation of additional C-terminal SP sites.

27823936|t|Phospho-mutant proneural proteins show both an enhanced stability compared to their wild-type counterparts, but also exhibit enhanced DNA binding affinity, and both of these attributes contribute to superior reprogramming activity [5], [7]. To test whether MyoD phospho-status influences protein binding to embryonic chromatin, embryos were injected as before, and cross-linking was performed in stage 13 embryos prior to nuclear extraction, chromatin isolation and western blot analysis (Fig. 4B, D). Cytoplasmic samples were also collected and MyoD protein accumulation was calculated relative to tubulin or histone H3 loading controls in cytoplasmic and chromatin fractions respectively. The absence of tubulin protein in the chromatin fraction confirms successful chromatin isolation, and no MyoD protein was detected in the uninjected embryos, confirming specificity of the anti-HA antibody.
27823936|a|

27823936|t|Comparing the relative amounts of chromatin bound MyoD protein (Fig. 4D) with the relative amounts of whole embryo MyoD protein (Fig. 4C), S200A MyoD is only 1.6-fold higher than WT MyoD in chromatin samples, suggesting that S200A displays greater protein stability than WT MyoD, but no greater chromatin binding affinity. Therefore, protein stability alone contributes to the enhanced activity of this mutant S200A protein. In contrast, chromatin-bound CT 5T/S-A MyoD accumulates to five-fold higher than WT and three-fold higher than S200A MyoD, demonstrating an increased chromatin binding affinity in addition to increased protein accumulation. Thus, our optimal phospho-mutant CT 5T/S-A dramatically enhances myogenesis in vivo by a combination of increased protein accumulation and enhanced chromatin binding; this latter feature being unique to the CT 5T/S-A MyoD phospho-mutant and not shared with S200A MyoD.

27823936|t|Discussion
27823936|a|

27823936|t|The bHLH transcription factor MyoD is a master regulator of myogenesis, and manipulating its activity both for in vitro modelling of muscle disease and for cell replacement therapy has huge potential in translation medicine and cellular reprogramming [18]. We set out to engineer a maximally active form of MyoD for in vivo reprogramming in the Xenopus frog system. Neurogenin2, Ascl1 and NeuroD4, bHLH transcription factors regulating neurogenesis, undergo multi-site phosphorylation that coordinates neuronal differentiation with the cellular kinase environment in vivo [5], [6], [7], [8]. As such, multi-site bHLH protein phosphorylation in rapidly dividing cells suppresses their ability to drive neuronal differentiation; a multiply phospho-mutant form of these proneural proteins substantially enhances their ability to reprogram both Xenopus ectoderm and mammalian fibroblasts into neurons [5], [6], [7], [8]. Here, we show here that multi-site phosphorylation also controls the ability of MyoD to regulate cellular reprogramming to muscle in vivo, demonstrating conservation of a similar regulation of bHLH proteins across cell lineages and germ layers.
27823936|a|

27823936|t|Analogous to our findings for proneural bHLH proteins [5], [6], [7], [8], we see that MyoD is phospho-regulated on multiple proline-directed kinase sites during developmental myogenesis. Moreover, by combining mutational analysis with this in vivo assay system, we have identified an optimal phospho-mutant form of MyoD, CT 5T/S-A MyoD, that displays markedly enhanced ability to drive myogenic differentiation compared to any previously described phospho-mutant [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Our optimal C terminal phospho-mutant protein displays increased protein stability relative to both WT MyoD and S200A MyoD, a mutant previously shown to have enhanced stability and activity compared to the WT protein [10], [11], [12]. In addition, we also see that CT 5T/S-A MyoD has increased chromatin affinity that is not shared by S200A MyoD. The data we present here, in combination with previous work on proneural proteins [5], [6], [7], [8], support the conservation of a phospho-regulatory model of bHLH protein action, both functionally and mechanistically, across both nerve and muscle cell lineages.

27823936|t|However, in contrast to proneural proteins where only the number of available phospho-sites is key to regulating protein function [5], [6], [7], [8], we find that both number and location of phospho-sites are important for MyoD, with regulatory phospho-sites located solely in the C terminus of the protein. In contrast to MyoD N terminal phospho-sites, C terminal sites show strong sequence conservation between species. Indeed, even in proliferating myoblasts, four major isoforms of MyoD were found to be subsequently resolved by phosphatase treatment [10], and an early in vitro assay found increased reporter transactivation when other individual C terminal proline-directed kinase sites were mutated [12]. These were found not to be phosphorylated by cdks in dividing culture cells, but they may be targeted by other proline-directed kinases such as MAPKs in the environment of the differentiating myotome.

27823936|t|The distinct C terminal location of regulatory phospho-sites may also relate to the complexity of MyoD function that is being revealed by genome-wide analysis. MyoD temporally orchestrates expression of multiple subsets of genes during the specification and differentiation stages of myogenesis [19]. Additionally, MyoD has been found to bind at sites throughout the genome where it induces histone modifications rather than gene expression [20]. Thus, for MyoD, DNA binding affinity does not always correlate with transcriptional activation and instead, the timing and location of cofactor association may be the critical determinant for temporal and spatial activity. For example, genome-wide analysis has shown that MyoD transcriptional activity is temporally regulated through a direct repression of promoter-bound MyoD [19]. A comparison of the genome-wide promoter occupancy of both WT and phospho-mutant MyoD may reveal clues as to potential differential phospho-regulation of distinct downstream MyoD targets. Furthermore, consistent with a role in cofactor association, the ability of MyoD to activate transcription in inaccessible chromatin has been mapped to the C terminal domain [21], and partly attributed to the helix 3 domain [22] that enables binding to pioneer factors Pbx/Meis [23]; spanning resides 218–269, this includes the S262 phospho-site. It will be interesting to determine whether co-factor binding is regulated by MyoD phosphorylation.

27823936|t|In conclusion, we have characterised multi-site phospho-regulation of MyoD on C-terminal S/TP sites that controls its ability to drive myogenesis in vivo: Whilst there are differences between the myogenic and neurogenic bHLH factors, the essence of multi-site phospho-regulation is both functionally and mechanistically conserved in muscle and nerve. Using an in vivo developmental and reprogramming assay system in Xenopus embryos, we have derived a novel C terminal phospho-mutant MyoD protein that has significantly enhanced myogenic activity compared to any previously described mutants. This has the potential for enhancing trans-differentiation of mammalian cells into muscle for translational applications, and this should form the basis of further investigations.

28249574|t|Reactivation of occult or inactive Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during immunosuppressant treatments is well known and widely described in literature. The same observation has been made in Hepatitis C (HCV)-infected patients previously exposed to HBV and treated with interferon-free DAA treatments. Because of common transmission routes, persons may have been exposed to HCV, HBV and HIV, but few cases have been reported in this scenario to date. Frequency of HBV reactivation in HIV/HCV co-infected patients previously exposed to HBV and treated with DAA remains unclear. Herein, we report an episode of HBV reactivation in an HIV/HCV co-infected patient prescribed with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for HCV.

HCV had not been treated with interferon (IFN)-based regimens and liver stiffness was 10.5 KPa (Metavir stage F3) at hepatic elastography. Because of CKD, she was prescribed with a nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI)-sparing regimen including darunavir/ritonavir plus etravirine, and thereafter with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for 12 weeks. Four weeks after DAA termination, the patient was hospitalized with symptoms of acute hepatitis. Blood tests showed HCV RNA <12 IU/ml, but positivity of HBAg, HBeAg, and of anti-core antibodies (IgM and IgG), while anti-HBs and anti-HBe antibodies were negative. HBV DNA was 6.06 Log10 IU/ml. Entecavir was started obtaining resolution of symptoms, normalization of liver enzymes, as well as reduction of HBV DNA and of quantitative HBV surface antigen.

28249574|t|This case-report highlights the risk of HBV reactivation with interferon-free DAA treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients previously exposed to HBV and who have contraindications for treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase Inhibitors because of comorbid conditions. In the setting of HIV infection, clinicians prescribing DAA should be aware of this risk, and HBV assessment at treatment start as well as virological monitoring during DAA treatment is recommended. Large epidemiological and virological studies are needed to investigate reactivation of occult HBV infection more in depth.

28249574|t|Background
28249574|a|

28249574|t|Reactivation of HBV infection during immunosuppressant treatments is well known and widely described in literature [1]. The risk concerns subjects with occult HBV infection (HBV DNA detected in serum or in the liver in HBsAg-negative patients with or without serologic markers of previous viral exposure) or inactive HBV chronic carriers (HBsAg-positive with normal ALT and HBV DNA <3.30 log10 IU/ml), either undergoing transplant or treated with chemotherapy or immunosuppressant drugs for hematologic malignancies or rheumatologic disorders [2].
28249574|a|

28249574|t|In the past, with the use of interferon (IFN)-based HCV therapy, exacerbation of acute HBV hepatitis in HBV-exposed patients has been described and an immune modulating role of IFN postulated [3]. More recently, a similar observation has been made with the use of interferon-free directly acting antivirals (DAA) for HCV treatment [4]. In HIV/HCV co-infected patients, who show HCV cure rates comparable to the general population [5], only very few cases of HBV reactivation have been reported [6–10]. Thus, the frequency of HBV reactivation in HIV/HCV co-infected patients previously exposed to HBV and treated with DAA remains unclear.
28249574|a|

28249574|t|Herein, we report an episode of reactivation of occult HBV infection in an HIV/HCV co-infected patient prescribed with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for HCV treatment. Further, a short review of similar cases published in literature is outlined.

28249574|t|The patient is a Caucasian 54-years old female diagnosed with HIV in 1986 and with chronic HCV hepatitis (genotype 4) in 1992. For many years, she was lost to follow-up and refused antiretroviral therapy presenting only once in 2011, when blood tests showed HIV RNA 4.93 log10 IU/ml, CD4 cells 245/mmc. Concurrently, previous exposure to HBV infection was documented: 12.2 mIU/ml HBsAb (positive >10 mIU/ml), positive HBcAb, and negative HBsAg at 0.01 IU/ml (positive >0.05 IU/ml). Afterwards she showed up again in June 2015, when viroimmunological exams showed: HIV RNA 5.28 log10 copies/ml and CD4 count 218/mmc. At that time, her medical history included: myocardial infarct, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and mild pulmonary hypertension. HCV had not been treated with IFN-based regimens and liver stiffness was 10.5 KPa (Metavir stage F3) at hepatic elastography. Because of CKD, first-line antiretroviral treatment was a nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI)-sparing regimen including darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg plus etravirine 400 mg QD. In January 2016, blood tests showed HIV RNA not detected <40 copies/ml with CD4 cells 283/mmc and treatment with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir 400/90 mg once daily was prescribed for 12 weeks. In May 2016, four weeks after treatment completion, the patient presented with jaundice reporting vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. She was admitted to hospital, and an elevation of liver enzymes (ALT 435 IU/l and AST 410 IU/l, respectively) and total bilirubin at 7.1 mg/dl were documented. HCV RNA was <12 IU/ml, HIV RNA <40 copies/ml and CD4 count had increased to 561/mmc. With regards to HBV markers, HBsAg (3.71 log10 IU/ml) and HBeAg changed into positive together with IgM and IgG HBcAb, while HBsAb and HBeAb remained negative. Furthermore, HBV DNA was 6.06 log10 IU/ml. Treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg once daily was promptly started obtaining resolution of symptoms. One month later, blood tests documented normalization of transaminases and reduction of HBV DNA at 3.78 log10 IU/l, of HBsAg 1.91 log10 IU/ml and negativization of HBeAg (Fig. 1). Treatment for HBV infection is still ongoing without adverse events and sustained virological response for HCV was achieved at 12 and at 24 weeks of observation.

28249574|a|

28249574|t|Characteristics of patients with HBV reactivation during or after DAA treatment for HCV published in literature
28249574|a|

28249574|t|HBV reactivation of occult or inactive HBV infection in HCV-infected persons during or after DAA therapy is considered a rare event, even though lately an important warning by the FDA about 24 cases of HBV reactivation during DAA HCV treatment has been released [11]. In literature to date, only six cases of these have been reported and characteristics are summarized in Table 1: all events occurred in subjects aged 50 years or more, mostly infected by HCV genotype 1, with frequent previous IFN exposure, and treated with sofobuvir- or daclatasvir-based DAA regimens. Notably, only one case referred to a person with HIV co-infection. Occasionally HBV reactivation occurred during DAA treatment, while otherwise it developed after treatment completion. In some cases, diagnosis was retrospectively established.

28249574|t|To date, risk of HBV reactivation during treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir seems low, and our patient is only the second case described in literature [7]. Regarding frequency of the event, reassuring data are available from a recent study by Sulkowski et al., which retrospectively reanalyzed HBV markers in serum samples of 173 HCV-infected patients without active HBV or HIV infection and treated with a combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Notably, HBV reactivation during or after HCV clearance was found in none out of the 103 previously HBV-exposed patients [12]. Differently, in patients with HCV and HBV co-infection, transitory HBV DNA reactivation rate seems very high, reaching 88% of a small case series treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir [13]. Since accurate information regarding risk of HBV reactivation in patients undergoing DAA therapy is lacking, an important prospective study is ongoing in patients with active HBV/HCV infection [13], but the issue should also be addressed in HCV-infected patients with occult HBV infection.

28249574	733	754	ledipasvir/sofosbuvir	Chemical	MESH:C000595958

28249574|t|In our patient, the rapid clearance of HCV RNA with DAA treatment could have triggered HBV reactivation leading to acute symptomatic hepatitis B. It also should to be noted that, the low levels of HBsAb in 2011 and the absence of this protective marker at hepatitis onset, might have played an important role in allowing HBV reactivation. In fact, our patient was not taking any ARV regimen for 15 years after HIV diagnosis and this has led to marked immunodeficiency: similarly to what happens in patients undergoing allogenic stem cells transplantation, we can assume that she may have lost her immunity against HBV [14].
28249574|a|

28249574|t|The molecular mechanisms involved in HCV/HBV interferences are controversial and incompletely understood. It seems that HBV can be chronically suppressed by HCV infection with alternate phases of dominance of one virus on the other [15, 16] and a suppressing effect of HCV core proteins on HBV replication has been postulated in some studies [17, 18]. Other studies have suggested that, host genes and immune regulation, such as kinase pathways or microRNA pathways, mediate the mechanism of underlying HBV inhibition [19, 20]. Regardless of the molecular mechanisms involved in HCV/HBV co-infection, the introduction of DAA drugs that are specifically directed against HCV without inhibitory effect on HBV may unbalance viral and/or host interactions and eventually allow HBV reactivation [21].
28249574|a|

28249574|t|Our case report poses some further questions, because the patient had HBV reactivation after DAA treatment, but also was HIV-positive making the scenario even more complex. On one side, HIV-infected patients may experience various levels of immune deficiency, because of lower CD4 cell count and immune dysregulation [22], malignancies or rheumatologic diseases. Also immune reconstitution in antiretroviral-treated patients may play a role in the same direction. In fact, reactivation of several latent infections, including HBV infection, is facilitated by immune reconstitution [23], and our patient experienced a relevant increase in CD4 cell count when comparing values before and after DAA treatment. On the contrary however, it is likely that a considerable proportion of patients with HIV infection will receive anti-HBV agents, like lamivudine, emtricitabine or tenofovir, as part of their antiretroviral therapy during DAA therapy, and therefore will be protected from HBV reactivation. Nonetheless, this may not apply to a considerable number of HIV-positive patients, that have contraindications for treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase Inhibitors because of comorbid conditions and who receive dual regimens [24].

28096460|t|The human dopamine transporter (DAT) has a tetrahedral Zn2+-binding site. Zn2+-binding sites are also recognized by other first-row transition metals. Excessive accumulation of manganese or of copper can lead to parkinsonism because of dopamine deficiency. Accordingly, we examined the effect of Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ on transport-associated currents through DAT and DAT-H193K, a mutant with a disrupted Zn2+-binding site. All transition metals except Mn2+ modulated the transport cycle of wild-type DAT with affinities in the low micromolar range. In this concentration range, they were devoid of any action on DAT-H193K. The active transition metals reduced the affinity of DAT for dopamine. The affinity shift was most pronounced for Cu2+, followed by Ni2+ and Zn2+ (= Co2+). The extent of the affinity shift and the reciprocal effect of substrate on metal affinity accounted for the different modes of action: Ni2+ and Cu2+ uniformly stimulated and inhibited, respectively, the substrate-induced steady-state currents through DAT. In contrast, Zn2+ elicited biphasic effects on transport, i.e. stimulation at 1 μm and inhibition at 10 μm. A kinetic model that posited preferential binding of transition metal ions to the outward-facing apo state of DAT and a reciprocal interaction of dopamine and transition metals recapitulated all experimental findings. Allosteric activation of DAT via the Zn2+-binding site may be of interest to restore transport in loss-of-function mutants.

28096460|t|Introduction
28096460|a|

28096460|t|The physiological role of the dopamine transporter (DAT/SLC6A3)3 is to clear the extracellular space from previously released dopamine and to replenish vesicular stores (1). Accordingly, the transport capacity of DAT shapes the synaptic response. We recently showed that the endogenous ligand Zn2+ increases the turnover rate of DAT (2). This action of Zn2+ is presumably of physiological relevance: Zn2+ is accumulated in synaptic vesicles via a dedicated transporter (ZnT3/SLC30A3) and released as a co-transmitter (3).

28096460|t|Numerous proteins require Zn2+ for their activity; it has been estimated that about 10% of the proteins encoded by the human genome bind Zn2+ (4). Similarly, about 30% of all enzymes are thought to require Zn2+ for catalysis (5). In addition, structural Zn2+-binding sites are important for protein stability, e.g. in transcription factors harboring the eponymous zinc fingers (6). Zn2+-binding sites rely on the permutation of specific arrangements of cysteine, histidine, aspartate, and glutamate residues and, in catalytic Zn2+ sites, of water. The resulting affinities range from picomolar to micromolar (7). However, other first-row transition metal ions can also be trapped by these binding sites (5, 8). As an approximation, the stability of their interaction increases across the period to a maximum stability for complexes containing Cu2+, resulting in the Irving-Williams series: Mn2+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ < Cu2+ > Zn2+ (9). It is thought that mismetallation of proteins is prevented by controlling the concentration of metal ions in the compartment in which the target protein operates (4, 7).

28096460|t|Mismetallation of DAT may be of toxicological relevance. It has long been known that occupational exposure to manganese can result in a syndrome resembling idiopathic Parkinson's disease (10, 11). Studies in primates indicate that manganese poisoning impairs dopamine release in the basal ganglia (12). Loss-of-function mutations in the manganese transporter SLC39A14 result in manganese overload and cause a syndrome of childhood dystonia/parkinsonism (13). This is reminiscent of inactivating mutations of DAT/SLC6A3 (14). Inactivating mutations in SLC30A10, another manganese extruder, also gives rise to parkinsonism (15). Similarly, Wilson's disease is caused by a deficiency in the copper transporter ATP7B, which results in copper accumulation in the basal ganglia and produces, inter alia, Parkinsonian symptoms (16). Before the link between dopamine deficiency and Parkinson's disease had been established, it was noted that dopamine excretion was augmented in patients suffering from Wilson's disease (17). Accordingly, in this study, we explored the effect of transition metals on human DAT. In our analysis, we relied on electrophysiological recordings because they provided the time resolution required to dissect the actions of the transition metals on individual steps of the transport cycle. We observed that individual metals differ in their ability to affect the transport cycle of DAT because they differed in the extent to which they were subject to a reciprocal modulation by substrate.

28096460|t|Effects of Transition Metals on the Steady-state Current through DAT
28096460|a|

28096460|t|When challenged with substrate, monoamine transporters of the SLC6 family produce two types of currents that can be recorded in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration: an initial capacitive peak current that reflects the binding of substrate and co-substrate ions to the transporter and their movement in the electric field of the membrane (18, 19) and a sustained, steady-state current that reflects movement of the transporter through the transport cycle (18). These two components can be seen when dopamine is applied to a voltage-clamped HEK293 cell expressing DAT in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration (cf. Fig. 1, A–E). Zn2+ accelerates the return step, i.e. the transition of the empty inward-facing to the outward-facing state of the transporter (2). The resulting acceleration of the transport cycle resulted in an increase in the steady-state current when Zn2+ was applied while the cell was continuously superfused with dopamine (Fig. 1E). We employed Zn2+ at 10 μm because this was shown previously to be a saturating concentration (20–23). We compared the action of the transition metals Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ (Fig. 1, A–D) with that of Zn2+ (Fig. 1E). We found Mn2+ to be ineffective at concentrations between 1 and 100 μm. In Fig. 1, A and F, we show the absence of any effect at 30 and 100 μm.

28096460|t|Effects of first-row transition metals on the steady-state current amplitude (Isteady-state) carried by hDAT. HEK293 cells stably expressing hDAT were voltage-clamped to −60 mV. The cells were challenged with 30 μm dopamine (DA). After 2 s, the transition metal was co-applied for 3 s as indicated. A, co-application of 30 μm Mn2+ was ineffective. B, C, and E, co-application of 10 μm Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ stimulated the current. D, 10 μm Cu2+ led to inhibition. In all instances, the steady-state current recovered to its initial amplitude upon metal removal. F, the steady-state current upon co-application of the indicated transition metals was related to that seen prior to metal application (-fold change = Isteady-state after application / Isteady-state before application) to normalize for differences in current sizes in individual cells. Data represent mean ± S.D. The respective -fold changes were tested against the hypothetical value 1 (= no change, indicated as a dotted line in the bar graph) using Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test.

28096460|t|In contrast, application of 10 μm Co2+ (Fig. 1B) led to a small but significant increase in the steady-state current amplitude by about 10%. The current did not increase further in the presence of 30 μm Co2+ (Fig. 1F). This weak stimulatory effect of Co2+ precluded further analysis. Application of 10 μm Ni2+ resulted in a robust increase in the steady-state current, which relaxed to its initial amplitude upon removal of Ni2+ (Fig. 1C). We also tested 3 and 30 μm Ni2+ (summarized in Fig. 1F). The effect elicited by 30 μm Ni2+ was essentially comparable with that caused by 10 μm Ni2+, indicating that, at saturating levels of Ni2+, the steady-state currents were about 1.3-fold larger than in the absence of any metal. Contrary to Co2+ and Ni2+, Cu2+ reversibly inhibited the steady-state current through DAT (Fig. 1D) with an IC50 of 4.4 μm (2.3–8.2 μm, 95% confidence interval). These observations suggest that all tested transition metals except Mn2+ either stimulate or inhibit the transport cycle of DAT. Two explanations can account for the inability of Mn2+ to modulate the activity of DAT: Mn2+ binds but neither stimulates nor inhibits the transport cycle, or the affinity of Mn2+ for the Zn2+-binding site of DAT is too low. We distinguished between these two possibilities by first concomitantly applying 30 μm dopamine and 100 μm Mn2+ to elicit the steady-state current through DAT. If Mn2+ had occupied the Zn2+-binding site of DAT, then it should preclude the increase in steady-state current resulting from the subsequent application of Zn2+. This, however, was not the case. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, wash-in of Zn2+ induced a robust stimulation of the current that was similar to that seen in the absence of Mn2+ (cf. Fig. 2F, first and fifth columns).

28096460|t|We also verified that both the stimulatory action of Co2+ and Ni2+ and the inhibitory action of Cu2+ required the Zn2+-binding site of DAT by examining their action on steady-state currents through DAT-H193K. In this mutant, the Zn2+-coordinating histidine is replaced by lysine, the residue found at the equivalent position of the norepinephrine transporter. The norepinephrine transporter is the closest relative of DAT but is insensitive to Zn2+. Accordingly, the mutation of His193 to Lys eliminates high-affinity Zn2+ binding to DAT (20, 21). It is evident from the current traces shown in Fig. 2, B–E, and the summary shown in Fig. 1F that both the stimulation of the steady-state current by Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ and its inhibition by Cu2+ were abrogated in DAT-H193K. This comparison is based on recordings done in a stable cell line and transiently transfected cells for wild-type DAT (Fig. 1) and the DAT-H193K mutant (Fig. 2), respectively. We also recorded currents through wild-type DAT in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. These experiments recapitulated the data shown in Fig. 1, i.e. stimulation of substrate-induced currents by Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, their inhibition by Cu2+, and the absence of any effect in the presence of Mn2+ (data not shown). Hence, we rule out that differences between transiently and stably transfected cells can account for the distinct effects of transition metals on wild-type and DAT-H913K.

28096460|t|Transition Metal-induced Shifts of EC50 for Substrate-induced Steady-state Currents through hDAT
28096460|a|

28096460|t|The substrate-induced steady-state current reflects cycling of DAT through the forward transport mode (18). Dopamine increased the steady-state current through DAT in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). This concentration-response curve was shifted by all transition metals; representative original traces are shown in Fig. 3, B–E, for dopamine-induced steady-state currents in the presence of 10 μm Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+, respectively. The pertinent analysis for all transition metals is summarized in Fig. 3E; the concentration-response curve was adequately described by a saturation hyperbola. More importantly, all transition metals reduced the apparent affinity of dopamine, but the magnitude of the shift differed. In the absence of any metal, the EC50 for the currents induced by dopamine was 0.8 μm (0.6–1 μm, 95% confidence interval) and increased to EC50 Zn2+ = 1.6 μm (1.2–2.2 μm), EC50 Co2+ = 2.4 μm (2.1–2.8 μm), EC50 Ni2+ = 4.3 μm (3.5–4.7 μm), and EC50 Cu2+ = 36.5 μm (17.1–72.2 μm) in the presence of Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+, respectively.

28096460|t|Taken together, the data summarized in Figs. 1–3 indicate that transition metals induced distinct effects on the transport cycle of DAT despite their binding to the same site: Cu2+ was uniformly inhibitory. The action of Zn2+ depends on the substrate concentration and the internal Na+ concentration (see below and Refs. 2, 22–24). Accordingly, we selected Ni2+ as an additional representative of the transition metals to understand their action on DAT because, contrary to Co2+, Ni2+ elicited a robust enhancement of the steady-state current. We recently demonstrated that current stimulation by Zn2+ is caused by an enhancement of the turnover rate of DAT (2). We verified that this was also true for Ni2+ by examining the turnover rate; the pertinent protocol and representative current traces are shown in Fig. 4. The approach relies on the paired application of substrate (i.e. dopamine) pulses. The first application elicits a robust peak current that corresponds to the conformational transition associated with substrate binding and drives DAT into the transport cycle, which gives rise to the sustained steady-state current. This steady-state current decays when substrate is withheld. During this decay, only a fraction of the transporters are available for binding of dopamine because they have not yet reached the outward-facing conformation. Full recovery of the peak current is achieved only after all transporters have completed the transport cycle. Hence, the rate of peak current recovery is a measure of the turnover rate. The time-dependent recovery of the peak current is evident from the original traces shown in Fig. 4A. The shorter the interval between the first and the second substrate pulse, the smaller a peak current was elicited by the second dopamine pulse. Full recovery was accomplished within 2 s with a time course that was adequately described by a monoexponential rise (Fig. 4B, open symbols. In the presence of Ni2+, the peak current recovered at a faster rate (Fig. 4B, closed symbols). Thus, similar to Zn2+, Ni2+ significantly accelerated the transport cycle of hDAT (p < 0.0001, F test).

A, protocol to measure the turnover rate of DAT. 30 μm dopamine was applied to the cell for 0.5 s. This was followed by a second pulse (30 μm dopamine for 0.5 s) applied after different wash intervals (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5, and 2 s). The peak current recovered over time and reached its full amplitude after prolonged dopamine-free intervals. B, the peak current recovers faster in the presence of 10 μm Ni2+ (green circle) in comparison with the control. The peak currents were normalized to the respective largest peak current from the same cell. The time course of the peak current recovery was fit to a monoexponential function (black lines, R2 = 0.96 and 0.96). The time constants estimated by the fits were as follows: control, 0.55 s (0.51–0.60, n = 6); Ni2+, 0.38 s (0.35–0.42, n = 6). Data represent mean and 95% confidence interval (in parentheses).

28096460|t|This analysis of currents through DAT is consistent with the interpretation that Ni2+ acts as a stimulator of substrate uptake. We verified this conjecture by comparing cellular uptake of dopamine by hDAT in the absence and presence of 1 and 10 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 5A) and Ni2+ (Fig. 5C). Uptake of [3H]dopamine uptake was stimulated at both Ni2+ concentrations. In contrast, [3H]dopamine uptake was stimulated by 1 μm Zn2+ but inhibited by 10 μm Zn2+. This biphasic action of Zn2+ on substrate uptake in HEK293 cells has not been reported previously (20, 21). However, in earlier studies, the action of Zn2+ on substrate uptake by hDAT was explored at substrate concentrations below the Km of the transporter. Thus, we surmise that the stimulation at low Zn2+ concentrations escaped detection in studies (20, 21) that examined the action of Zn2+ at non-saturating substrate concentrations. We explored the biphasic effect of Zn2+ in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations (30 μm dopamine) in the absence and presence of 0.1, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 5B). Under these conditions, the stimulation of maximal transport velocity peaks at about 1 μm Zn2+. We also explored the effect of Ni2+ at saturating substrate concentrations (30 μm dopamine) in the absence and presence of 1, 10, and 30 μm Ni2+. We found substrate uptake stimulated for Ni2+ concentrations up to 30 μm (Fig. 5D). At concentrations exceeding 30 μm, Ni2+ causes a nonspecific inhibition of transport, i.e. this inhibition is also seen in DAT-H193K (data not shown). Accordingly, it was not possible to examine how higher concentrations of Ni2+ affected substrate transport via the transition metal ion-binding site.

28096460|t|The action of Zn2+ depends on the intracellular sodium concentration. At low [Na+]i, Zn2+ acts as an activator of dopamine transport, but it is inhibitory when [Na+]i is high. This is the case in HEK293 cells overexpressing DAT (2, 22–24). Accordingly, the finding that Ni2+ increased substrate uptake into HEK293 cells suggested that Ni2+ can also stimulate DAT at high [Na+]i. We tested this conjecture by comparing the action of 10 μm Zn2+ and 10 μm Ni2+ on currents by DAT in the presence of 25 mm Na+i. Fig. 6A shows representative currents through hDAT that were induced by the rapid application of 30 μm dopamine followed by the concomitant superfusion with 10 μm Ni2+ (Fig. 6A, left panel) or 10 μm Ni2+ (Fig. 6A, right panel) for 5 s. It is evident from these recordings that, in the presence of 25 mm [Na+]i, Zn2+ inhibits the steady-state current whereas Ni2+ does not. Although we failed to detect current inhibition in the presence of 10 μm Ni2+, it is worth pointing out that the stimulatory effect of Ni2+ was lower with 25 mm [Na+]i than the one observed with 6 mm [Na+]i (Fig. 1C). This suggests that, although the inhibitory action of [Na+]i is smaller with Ni2+ than with Zn2+, it is not fully eliminated.

28096460|t|The substrate-induced peak current reflects the initiation of the transport cycle, where substrate and co-substrate ions are bound by the transporter and moved through the electric field of the membrane (18, 19). Zn2+ decreases the amplitude of this substrate-induced peak current (2), presumably because Zn2+ does not only favor the return of the empty transporter (forward transport mode) but also the return of the substrate-bound transporter to the outward-facing state (substrate exchange mode) (2). Accordingly, the charge that gives rise to the inwardly directed peak current is moved into the opposite direction, and, hence, the peak current amplitude is decreased. Ni2+ and Zn2+ differed in their ability to stimulate steady-state transport. In the micromolar range, Ni2+ uniformly stimulated substrate uptake, but Zn2+ gave rise to a stimulation at 1 μm and inhibition at 10 μm (cf. Fig. 5A). This suggests that Zn2+ and Ni2+ do not affect the conformational transitions hDAT must undergo during the transport cycle in the same way. Hence, we compared the effect of Ni2+ on the dopamine-induced peak current by employing the protocol shown in Fig. 7A. We applied 10 μm Ni2+ or Zn2+ for 5 s to a HEK293 cell expressing hDAT. Subsequently, test pulses of 30 μm dopamine were applied immediately or 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 s after removal of the metal ion. As can be seen in Fig. 7B, the effect of Ni2+ on the peak current was much smaller than that of Zn2+. Although Zn2+ decreased the peak current amplitude by about 30%, Ni2+ only affected it to a very minor extent.

28096460|t|Comparison of Ni2+- and Zn2+-induced changes in the peak current. A, protocol for determining the effect of Ni2+ (or Zn2+) on the peak current by hDAT. A HEK293 cell stably expressing hDAT was clamped to −60 mV and exposed to 10 μm Ni2+ for 5 s. After wash periods of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 s, a peak current was triggered by rapid application of 30 μm dopamine (0.5 s). The original traces are from a representative experiment that was reproduced in seven independent experiments with 10 μm Ni2+ and Zn2+, respectively. B, recovery of the peak current following application of 10 μm Ni2+ (green circles) and 10 μm Zn2+ (blue circles), respectively. The peak current amplitudes were normalized to the respective largest current and plotted as a function of the wash time interval. The two sets of data points were each fit to a monoexponential function (green and blue lines). The fits yielded the following parameters: Ni2+, Trecovery = 0.15 s (0.07–5.66), blocked fraction 13% (10–17); Zn2+, Trecovery = 1.25 s (0.82–2.5), blocked fraction 28% (22–33). Data represent mean and 95% confidence interval (in parentheses). The estimated blocked fractions were significantly different (p < 0.0001, F-test).

28096460|t|During amphetamine-induced substrate release, DAT operates in the substrate exchange mode rather than the forward transport mode, i.e. amphetamine is carried inward and exchanged for dopamine (25, 26, 27). As outlined above, Zn2+ inhibits the peak current because it favors substrate exchange. Accordingly, Zn2+ increases amphetamine-induced substrate release mediated by DAT (21). In contrast, Ni2+ reduced the peak current amplitude only to a very modest extent (cf. Fig. 7) and did not block the steady-state current (i.e. the forward transport mode) in the presence of elevated [Na+]i. Based on our model, these findings predict that, contrary to Zn2+, Ni2+ does not enhance amphetamine-induced substrate efflux. This conjecture was verified (Fig. 8). In hDAT-expressing HEK293 cells that had been preloaded with [3H]MPP+, superfusion with 3 μm d-amphetamine (AMPH) caused a robust release of radioactive substrate that was further augmented by the concomitant application of 10 μm Zn2+. In contrast, Ni2+ did not enhance amphetamine-induced substrate release.

28096460|t|Stimulation of amphetamine-induced [3H]MPP+ release by Zn2+ but not Ni2+. HEK293 cells transfected with hDAT loaded with [3H]MPP+ were superfused with KHP buffer for 45 min (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thereafter (time point 0), 2-min fractions were collected. The prior interval of 45 min allowed for establishing a stable baseline as verified by the first seven fractions. After 12 min, 3 μm AMPH was added, which resulted in [3H]MPP+ release (black circles). This increase was larger in the presence of 10 μm Zn2+ (blue circles) but unchanged in the presence of 10 μm Ni2+ (green circles). The data are averages of 12 experiments. The data points at 20 and 22 min were used to conduct a one-way analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test (post hoc test). The difference between AMPH and AMPH + 10 μm Zn2+ is significant (p = 0.026).

28096460|t|Discussion
28096460|a|

28096460|t|DAT has a tetrahedral Zn2+-binding site. The coordination sphere is comprised of H193 in extracellular loop 2 (EL2), His375 and Glu396, which reside on top of transmembrane helix 7 in the first helical part of extracellular loop 4 (EL4A) and on top of transmembrane helix 8 in the second helix of extracellular loop 4 (EL4B), respectively (28), and Asp206 in EL2 (29). The extracellular loops are thought to be flexible, in particular the extended EL2 (29). Accordingly, it is not surprising that this binding site can accommodate transition metals other than Zn2+ even when their optimum coordination geometries differ (5). In fact, our observations are in line with the general prediction of the Irving-William series. It was, however, surprising that the effects elicited by individual metal ions, in particular Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+, differed substantially. Ni2+ and Cu2+ uniformly stimulated and inhibited, respectively, the forward transport mode of DAT. In contrast, Zn2+ elicited biphasic effects. In addition, and most importantly, Zn2+ was the only transition metal ion that also promoted the substrate exchange mode. The different modes of action of the metals must be accounted for by a plausible model of the transport cycle. It is a priori reasonable to posit that occupancy of the Zn2+-binding site produces the same primary effect. In fact, this was the case. All effective metals shifted the EC50 of dopamine for eliciting the substrate-induced steady-state current, albeit to a different extent. The shift was most pronounced for Cu2+, followed by Ni2+ and Zn2+ (and Co2+). These shifts indicate that Zn2+, and, to a larger extent, Ni2+ and Cu2+, destabilized the substrate-bound conformation(s). Destabilization is most parsimoniously explained by preferred binding of these metals to the apo conformation(s) of DAT. Thermodynamics dictate that the effect on affinity must be reciprocal. If the transition metal lowers the affinity of DAT for substrate, then raising the substrate concentration must lower the affinity for metals. In addition, because individual metals differed in their ability to shift the EC50 of dopamine, they must discriminate between apo and substrate-bound transporters to different extents, with Zn2+ and Cu2+ having the least and most pronounced affinity differences, respectively.

28096460|t|We implemented this information into a kinetic model (18) that was extended to account for metal-bound states (Fig. 9A). This allowed for recapitulating all experimental findings. 1) It is, for instance, possible to account for the observation that low Zn2+ concentrations (1 μm) increased substrate uptake in the presence of high [Na+]i and for the biphasic effect of Zn2+ on substrate uptake. The conformation that displays the highest affinity for Zn2+ is the outward-facing apo state of DAT; the Zn2+-binding site is fully occupied at 1 μm. Upon substrate binding, the affinity at the binding site decreases, and Zn2+ dissociates. Thus, at low concentrations (1 μm), Zn2+ interacts almost exclusively with the apo conformations. This leads to an acceleration of the rate-limiting step in the transport cycle and stimulation of substrate uptake. At elevated concentrations (e.g. 10 μm), Zn2+ also binds to the substrate-loaded conformations. This gives rise to Zn2+-induced inhibition when [Na+]i is high (Fig. 9, E and G). 2) The key actions of Ni2+ were reproduced when the observation that Ni2+ induced a larger shift in the EC50 of dopamine than Zn2+ was incorporated into the model. These actions are stimulation of the dopamine-induced steady-state current by Ni2+ (Fig. 9B), the modest effect of Ni2+ on the peak current (Fig. 9H), and the stimulatory action of Ni2+ despite elevated [Na+]i (Fig. 9F). 3) Finally, the model also accounts for current inhibition by Cu2+ (Fig. 9C). In the presence of Cu2+, the shift in EC50 was most pronounced, i.e. larger than with any other transition metal (cf. Figs. 3C and 9D). This observation indicated that Cu2+ had the highest preference for the apo conformations. Hence, its uniform inhibitory action can be rationalized as follows. In the absence of Cu2+, 30 μm dopamine is a saturating concentration that induces maximal currents and allows the transporter to cycle at maximum velocity in the forward transport mode. In contrast, Cu2+ lowers the affinity of dopamine to an extent that a dopamine concentration of 30 μm does not suffice for saturation (Fig. 9D). This leads to a decrease in current amplitude, which reflects inhibition of dopamine transport by Cu2+. Thus, the parsimonious explanation for the action of transition metals on DAT is the reciprocal effect of substrate and metal: binding of one lowers the affinity for the respective other. Given the location of the coordinating residues, it is attractive to assume that occupancy of the Zn2+-binding site by metals precludes the transition of DAT from the outward open to the occluded state. By definition, this reduces the apparent substrate affinity because the substrate can more readily dissociate from the outward open than from the occluded state. Conversely, in the occluded state, the relative position of the residues that coordinate the transition metal is likely to change. This is predicted to translate into a decline in affinity for the metal.

28096460|t|The affinity of Mn2+ for the Zn2+-binding site of DAT was so low that there was no appreciable occupancy up to 100 μm Mn2+. This low affinity is consistent with the Irving-Williams series (5, 8, 9). Based on this low affinity, it appears unlikely that mismetallation of the Zn2+-binding site by manganese is relevant to the mechanistic understanding of manganese-induced dopamine deficiency (10–15). In contrast, in the low micromolar range, Cu2+ caused a profound inhibition of DAT. Hence, this inhibition may be relevant to understand symptoms that occur in the course of Wilson's disease for the following reasons. 1) Although it is difficult to estimate the free concentration of Cu2+ in the brain, the serum concentration of free Cu2+ (i.e. not bound to coeruloplasmin) is in the micromolar range (30). The concentration of Cu2+ at the site of dopaminergic projections is thought to exceed that in serum because Cu2+ accumulates in several brain regions, including the corpus striatum. Thus, Cu2+ levels in the brain are likely to reach concentrations that impair retrieval of dopamine by DAT and thus lead to a hypodopaminergic state. 2) Imaging studies suggest that a presynaptic dopaminergic deficit contributes to the neurological symptoms from which patients with Wilson's disease suffer (31–33). 3) In addition, patients with Wilson's disease are very susceptible to side effects of neuroleptic drugs that arise from dopamine receptor blockage in the caudate nucleus and putamen. When erroneously treated with both typical and atypical neuroleptic/antipsychotic drugs, these patients are prone to develop drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (34). This enhanced susceptibility presumably arises from low D2 receptor occupancy by endogenous dopamine because of impaired synaptic release. 4) Finally, administration of zinc (e.g. 150 mg of zinc acetate/day) is an effective treatment for Wilson's disease and can be used as an alternative to chelation therapy with d-penicillamine or trientine (16, 30). The effect relies on the Zn2+-dependent induction of metallothionein into the gut epithelium and the resulting reduced systemic bioavailability of dietary copper (16). Interestingly, Zn2+ has been found to be particularly effective in improving neurological deficits (30, 35) even when prior chelation therapy failed (36, 37). Based on this circumstantial evidence and on our observations, we propose that displacement of Cu2+ from the Zn2+-binding site of DAT may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of Zn2+ in Wilson's disease.

28096460|t|Occupancy of the allosteric Zn2+-binding site allows for a wide range of effects, i.e. stimulation and inhibition of the forward transport mode and enhancing the substrate exchange mode. It is likely that this binding site can be addressed by compounds other than transition metals. Allosteric activators of the forward transport mode are of particular interest. There are several loss-of-function mutations in the coding sequence of human DAT that lead to a syndrome of infantile or juvenile dystonia and parkinsonism (14). The vast majority of these mutations result in defective folding and, hence, retention of the mutated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, there are some mutants that do reach the cell surface but fail to transport dopamine with adequate turnover rates. A search for allosteric activators is therefore justified because they may act as correctors and restore the forward transport mode to a velocity that is commensurate with normal dopaminergic transmission (40). In fact, it appears worthwhile to test whether Ni2+ (or any other transition metal) accelerates transport in these mutants.

28096460|t|Whole-cell Patch Clamp
28096460|a|

28096460|t|HEK293 cells stably expressing hDAT or transiently expressing hDAT H193K were seeded at low density 24 h before recordings. Currents by the transporter were measured in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration. The electrode resistances were between 2–5 megohms. For the majority of the recordings, we used the following internal solution: 133 mm potassium gluconate, 6 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. For some experiments we used an internal solution containing 25 mm Na+, 25 mm NaCl, 125 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). The external solution in all experiments was 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For rapid solution exchange, we used an OctaFlow superfusion device (ALA Scientific, Farmingdale, NY). Cells were continuously superfused either with blank external solution or an external solution containing dopamine, respectively. For the solutions containing Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, or Cu2+, we used the respective chloride salts (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For current acquisition, we employed an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The cells were clamped to −60 mV, and the washout period following substrate application was 30 s in all cases. Current traces were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1550 (Molecular Devices). The currents induced by dopamine were quantified using Clampfit 10.2 software. Passive holding currents were subtracted, and the traces were filtered using a 100-Hz digital Gaussian low-pass filter.

28096460|t|HEK293 cells stably expressing hDAT were seeded on 48-well plates precoated with poly-d-lysine (0.5 × 105 cells/well) 24 h before the assay. Cells were first washed with 500 μl/well Krebs-HEPES buffer (KHP): 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.4) with NaOH. The cells were then incubated in 200 μl of KHP buffer containing 0.1 μm [3H]dopamine and diluted with the respective cold substrates to reach final concentrations ranging from 0.1–100 μm, both in the absence and presence of 1 and 10 μm ZnCl2 or NiCl2, respectively. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 min with [3H]dopamine. A subsequent wash with 500 μl/well of ice-cold KHP buffer terminated uptake. Cells were finally lysed with 500 μl of 1% SDS, transferred into 2 ml of scintillation mixture (Rotiszint Eco Plus LSC, Art. 0016.3, Carl Roth GmbH + Co.

28096460|t|Modeling
28096460|a|

28096460|t|The recorded currents were emulated with a previously published kinetic model of the transport cycle of DAT (2). This model was extended to account for the binding of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+. The time-dependent changes in state occupancies were evaluated by numerical integration of the resulting system of differential equations using Systems Biology Toolbox (38) and Matlab 2012a (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The voltage dependence of individual rates was modeled according to Laeuger (39), assuming a symmetric barrier as kij = k0ijexp(−zQijFV / 2RT), with F = 96,485 Cmol−1, r = 8.314 JK−1mol−1, V the membrane voltage in volts, and T = 293 K. The extra- and intracellular ion concentrations were set to the values used in the experiments. Substrate uptake was modeled as (TiClS × kSioff − TiCl × Si × kSion + TiClSZn × kSioff − TiClZn × Si × kSion) × NC/NA, where NC is the number of transporters and NA is the Avogadro constant. Currents and substrate uptake were simulated assuming a transporter density of 25 × 106/cell.

28420170|t|Background: Fisetin (3,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a dietary flavonol and exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. However, high concentration of fisetin is reported to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cause cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the cytoprotective effects of low concentration of fisetin against tunicamycin (Tm)-mediated cytotoxicity in neuronal-like catecholaminergic PC12 cells. Methods: Cell viability was assayed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and apoptotic and autophagic markers were analyzed by Western blot. Gene expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) and Phase II enzymes was further investigated using RT-Q-PCR or Western blotting. Intracellular ROS level was measured using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) by a fluorometer. The effects of fisetin on mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) signaling pathways were examined using Western blotting and specific inhibitors. Results: Fisetin (<20 µM) restored cell viability and repressed apoptosis, autophagy and ROS production in Tm-treated cells. Fisetin attenuated Tm-mediated expression of ER stress genes, such as glucose-regulated proteins 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP also known as GADD153) and Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), but induced the expression of nuclear E2 related factor (Nrf)2-targeted heme oxygenase (HO)-1, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and cystine/glutamate transporter (xCT/SLC7A11), in both the presence and absence of Tm. Moreover, fisetin enhanced phosphorylation of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase), and p38 MAPK. Addition of JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitor significantly antagonized its cytoprotective activity and modulatory effects on UPR. Fisetin also restored Tm-inhibited SIRT1 expression and addition of sirtinol (SIRT1 activation inhibitor) significantly blocked fisetin-mediated cytoprotection. In conclusion, this result shows that fisetin activates Nrf2, MAPK and SIRT1, which may elicit adaptive cellular stress response pathways so as to protect cells from Tm-induced cytotoxicity.

28420170|t|1. Introduction
28420170|a|

28420170|t|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic organelle responsible for the synthesis, correct folding, post-translational modification and transport of secretory proteins. Disturbance of ER function leads to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, and is referred to as ER stress [1]. The correlations between ER stress and neuronal degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are well documented [2]. ER stress can also be chemically induced by tunicamycin (Tm), an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces lysosuperificus. Tm induces ER stress by inhibiting microsomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase, which is responsible for the glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins [3].

28420170|t|The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a series of events that cells activate in order to cope with ER stress and to re-establish ER homeostasis [4,5]. UPR contains three parallel signalling branches: IRE1 (inositol-requiringprotein1)-XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1), ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) and PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase)-eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α)-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4). The three transcription factors activated, XBP1, ATF6, and ATF4, individually and collectively upregulate the transcription of ER chaperones, such as glucose-regulated proteins 78 (GRP78), ER biosynthetic machinery, and ER associated degradation (ERAD) components in order to resolve ER stress [6]. In the case of chronic or unmitigated ER stress, cell death pathways are induced [7]. ER stress-induced apoptosis is mediated mainly by C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP/GADD153) [8,9].

28420170|t|Emerging data also suggest that, in addition to UPR, autophagy is part of the global ER stress response [10,11]. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation [12]. Autophagosome formation is controlled by a well-orchestrated action of a distinctive set of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins. A key reaction involves the lipidation of Atg8 in autophagic membranes, which is facilitated by the Atg12–Atg5 conjugate [13].

28420170|t|Flavonoids are a group of bioactive compounds that are commonly found in fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans. Flavonoids and their metabolites can transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), making them ideal targets in the therapeutic utility for neurodegenerative disorders [14]. Numerous studies indicate that the anti-neurodegeneration effects of flavonoids are consistent with their roles as activators of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) or Nrf2 (nuclear E2 related factor 2)-ARE (antioxidant response element) [15,16,17,18]. The MAPK family, including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase), and p38, plays an essential role in transduction extracellular signals to cellular response via a cascade of phosphorylation events [19]. SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase, which regulates cellular metabolism, stress resistance, cellular survival, cellular senescence/aging, and inflammation-immune function [20]. It has been shown that SIRT1 overexpression in neurons promotes neurite outgrowth and cell survival [21]. Recently, it has been reported that the combination of tyrosol, a natural antioxidant phenol, and S-adenosylmethionine increased SIRT1 protein and its nuclear relocalization in ethanol-treated HepG2 cells and protected cells from oxidative stress [22]. Nrf2-ARE is a primary sensor and oxidative stress regulator [23]. Nrf2 activation upregulates the expression of a group of functionally diverse cytoprotective proteins, such as NAD(P)H, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), catalase, and thioredoxin [16].

28420170|t|Fisetin (3,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone, Figure 1a) is a flavonol with a wide range of bioactivites, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and neuroprotective effects. It has been reported that fisetin protects rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells from MPP+-induced toxicity by upregulation of the expression of Nrf2-induced antioxidant enzymes [24]. Fisetin has been shown to promote neuronal differentiation and long-term potentiation, maintain cognitive function and enhance memory in an animal model [25,26,27]. Fisetin also protects PC12 cells from hypoxia-induced PC12 cell death via activating the HIF1α, MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways [28]. Taken together, these studies show that fisetin is a potential compound with neuroprotective activity. However, the cytoprotective effect of fisetin on neuronal cells exposed to ER stress inducer is still unknown. The aim of this study is to dissect the molecular and biochemical pathways involved in fisetin-mediated cytoprotection in Tm-treated PC12 cells.

28420170|t|It was reported that fisetin at low concentrations provides neuroprotection in several models [25,26,27,28,29], while at high concentrations it induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ER stress and cell death in some tumor cells [30,31,32]. We found that treatment of PC12 cells with fisetin (up to 40 µM) alone for 16 h did not alter cell viability (Figure 1b). It is known that Tm blocks N-glycosylation of proteins, thus leading to ER stress [3] and ultimately apoptosis in PC12 cells [33,34]. Figure 1c shows that Tm (1–5 µg/mL) caused 30–40% PC12 cell death after 16 h. Treatment of PC12 cells with fisetin (5–20 µM) dose-dependently reversed 1 µg/mL Tm-mediated cell death (Figure 1d). The cytoprotective effects of fisetin were reconfirmed by Calcein AM viability dye staining (Figure S1) [35].

28420170|t|Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is specifically proteolysed by caspases to a 24 and a 89 kDa fragment during the execution of the apoptotic program [36]. Figure 2a shows that treatment of PC12 cells with fisetin (10–20 µM) in the absence of Tm for 16 h decreased PARP-1 processing in a dose-dependent manner, although it did not significantly change cell viability (Figure 1b). Tm (1 µg/mL) treatment increased PARP-1 cleavage as compared with no Tm control, and co-treatment with fisetin counteracted this reaction (Figure 2b). Band quantification shows that Tm induced a significant increase in the ratio of cleaved/full length PARP-1, and fisetin (10‒20 µM) dose-dependently attenuated Tm-mediated cleavage. This result indicates that fisetin serves as an anti-apoptotic agent in PC12 cells.

28420170|t|Autophagy and apoptosis are important and interconnected stress response mechanisms. Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg8, and is required for the formation of autophagosome membrane. The conversion of LC3β from LC3β-I (free form, 18 kDa) to LC3β-II (phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form, 16 kDa) is an initiating step in autophagy in mammals [37]. PC12 cells cultured in the absence of Tm did not cause the conversion of LC3β (Figure 2a). In comparison, Figure 2c shows that an increase in the LC3β-II in PC12 cells was observed in the presence of Tm (1 µg/mL), confirming that autophagy was induced by Tm. Co-treatment of cells with 10 and 20 µM fisetin dose-dependently reduced Tm-mediated increase in the ratio of LC3β-II/LC3β-I. The formation of Atg12–Atg5 conjugate is a key factor in regulating the formation of autophagosome [38]. In parallel to the results found for LC3β conversion, Tm treatment for 16 h also enhanced Atg12–Atg5 conjugate formation and co-treatment of fisetin (10 and 20 µM) blocked its formation. This result suggests that fisetin represses Tm-mediated autophagy in PC12 cells.

28420170|t|We further investigated the effect of fisetin on Tm-mediated ER stress response. The first target was X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA splicing, a critical signal transducer in the unfolded protein response. The levels of the unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and active spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA were measured by RT-PCR and subsequent polyacrylamide electrophoresis. It was found that Tm (1 µg/mL) treatment significantly increased XBP1 splicing, but co-treatment with fisetin (5–20 µM) did not change the relative level of XBP1s to that of XBP1u (Figure 3a). A similar phenomenon was also observed for eIF2α phosphorylation, another ER stress signal transducer upstream of ATF4. Tm (1 µg/mL) treatment markedly induced eIF2α phosphorylation, while fisetin (10–20 µM) did not change its level (Figure 3b). These results indicate that fisetin did not affect Tm-activated IRE1-XBP1 or PERK-eIF2 pathway.

28420170|t|We then investigated whether fisetin affected Tm-mediated ER-target gene expression. GRP78 and CHOP are canonically upregulated during apoptosis induced by ER stress. It was found that Tm treatment caused a strong increase in GRP78 mRNA expression, up by ~20-fold, while co-treatment with fisetin (10–20 µM) dose-dependently reduced its expression and 90% inhibition was noted at 20 µM (Figure 3c).

28420170|t|Figure 3d shows that Tm induced CHOP mRNA by ~22-fold and co-treatment with 15 and 20 µM fisetin could dose-dependently attenuate the upregulation by 77% and 88%, respectively. It has been reported that tribbles-related protein 3 (TRB3), a target gene of CHOP, was responsible for Tm-mediated PC12 apoptosis [39]. In parallel to the results found for CHOP mRNA expression, Figure 3e shows that treatment of PC12 cells with 1 µg/mL Tm increased TRB3 mRNA expression by 24.7-fold, and 15 and 20 µM fisetin could dose-dependently attenuate its upregulation. In conclusion, fisetin (10–20 µM) inhibited Tm-upregulated UPR mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner.

28420170|t|Western blotting reveals that treatment of PC12 cells with Tm modestly increased GRP78 and CHOP protein expression. Fisetin dose-dependently attenuated GRP78 expression; while its effect on Tm-mediated CHOP protein expression was less prominent (Figure 3f). The less obvious inhibition on CHOP protein expression could be due to the poor detection sensitivity and specificity of antibodies against rat CHOP.

Figure 4a shows that treatment of PC12 cells with fisetin (5–20 µM) alone for 16 h could decrease ROS level by about 15–20%. Treatment of PC12 cells with Tm (1 µg/mL) for 16 h modestly increased intracellular ROS production by about 11% (Figure 4b). Fisetin (10–20 µM) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) (1 mM), a well-known antioxidant, completely abolished Tm-mediated ROS overproduction to a level lower than that of vehicle control. Current data support the notion that fisetin serves as a ROS scavenger in PC12 cells [28].

28420170|t|Nrf2 (nuclear E2 related factor 2)-ARE (antioxidant response element) is a primary sensor and oxidative stress regulator [23]. Fisetin (10 µM) was reported to cause activation of Nrf2-ARE and upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), cystine/glutamate transporter (xCT/SLC7A11) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) in HT22 cells [25,41]. Figure 5a shows that fisetin (5–20 µM) treatment for 6 h significantly induced HO-1 mRNA expression in an inverted U curve, and the greatest increase (22-fold) was found for 10 µM. Consequently, HO-1 protein expression was significantly stimulated after fisetin treatment (Figure 5b). Band quantification shows that a hormetic dose–response curve was noted after 8 h treatment and ~4.5-fold induction was caused by 10 and 15 µM fisetin (Figure 5c). Treatment with fisetin for 16 h induced less HO-1 protein expression than treatment for 8 h, and plateau induction (~3.7-fold) was reached by doses equal to or higher than 15 µM.

These results suggest that fisetin induced a hormetic effect on Nrf2-driven mRNA expression of Phase II antioxidant enzymes.

28420170|t|We further investigated how fisetin affected Nrf2-driven gene expression in the presence of Tm. Figure 6a shows that Tm (1 µg/mL) only slightly stimulated HO-1 mRNA expression by 1.84-fold, and co-treatment with fisetin (10–20 µM) enhanced HO-1 upregulation dose-dependently. Figure 6b shows that in parallel to the results observed in mRNA expression, treatment of PC12 cells with Tm (1 µg/mL) for 16 h slightly upregulated HO-1 protein expression and fisetin enhanced HO-1 protein expression dose-dependently.

28420170|t|To further investigate whether the increased survival rate seen in fisetin-treated cells was dependent on HO-1 activity, PC12 cells were treated with ZnPP (zinc protoporphyrin IX), a potent competitive inhibitor of HO enzyme activity, for 30 min, followed by various concentrations of fisetin for 30 min before exposure to Tm (1 µg/mL) for 16 h. Figure 6c shows that the addition of ZnPP (0.25 and 1 µM) caused cytotoxicity on PC12 cells in all groups, and attenuated the fisetin-mediated cytoprotective effect dose-dependently. These results indicate that HO-1 activity may provide a survival advantage in PC12 cells.

In parallel to the results observed in the absence of Tm, fisetin (5–20 µM) enhanced xCT overexpression in an inverted U response curve in the presence of Tm (Figure 6f).

28420170|t|Induction of Nrf2 by flavonoids has been associated with the activation of various members of the MAPK family [43]. To investigate how fisetin affects MAPK activation, PC12 cells were treated with 10, 15 and 20 μM fisetin for 30 min prior to Tm (1 µg/mL) exposure for 2 and 4 h, and cell lysates were immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Figure 7a,b show that treatment of 1 µg/mL Tm for 2 and 4 h induced ERK and JNK activation, but not p38 MAPK activation. Co-treatment with fisetin (10–20 µM) significantly augmented ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK activation with different patterns: enhancement of ERK and JNK activation was noted during the test period, while p38 MAPK phosphorylation was only found 2 h after Tm insult.

28420170|t|To study the cytoprotective role of the MAPK pathways, PC12 cells were pre-incubated for 30 min with 5 µM inhibitor for each pathway, U0126 (ERK), SP600125 (JNK) and SB203580 (p38 MAPK), and 5–20 µM fisetin was then added 30 min prior to Tm (1 µM) exposure for 16 h. Figure 7c,d show that addition of JNK inhibitor SP600125 and p38 MAPK specific inhibitor SB203580 significantly exacerbated Tm-mediated cytotoxicity and attenuated the cytoprotective effects of fisetin. On the other hand, MEK inhibitor U0126 did not exert any effect on cell viability in the presence of Tm (Figure S2). These results indicate that JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, but not ERK, may be associated with the cytoprotective effect of fisetin.

28420170|a|

28420170|t|We further investigated whether JNK and p38 MAPK are involved in fisetin-mediated oxidative stress response gene expression. Figure 8a,b show that SB203580 significantly attenuated fisetin-enhanced HO-1 and xCT expression. This implies that fisetin-activated p38 MAPK signaling may be involved in upregulation of Nrf2-driven gene expression.

28420170|t|Furthermore, we investigated the role of JNK and p38 MAPK on ER stress responsive gene expression. Figure 8c,d show that Tm-mediated CHOP expression was increased by both SP600125 and SB203580, but GRP78 was only enhanced by SP600125. Furthermore, the 20 µM fisetin-inhibited expressions of CHOP and GRP78 were reversed by both SP600125 and SB203580. This indicates that both fisetin-mediated JNK and p38 MAPK activation may participate in down-regulation of ER stress. This result is in agreement with a previous finding that Tm-induced p38 MAPK activation may serve as an upstream negative regulator of ER stress, and confer adaptive cytoprotection against Tm-mediated cell injury [35].

28420170	15	22	Fisetin	Chemical	MESH:C017875

28420170|t|Fisetin is a SIRT1 activator that extends lifespan in lower organisms [44]. Fisetin also induces SIRT1 expression and inhibits early adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells [45]. We found here that Tm (1 µg/mL) treatment for 16 h significantly decreased SIRT1 expression, but co-treatment with fisetin (5–20 µM) reversed the reduction (Figure 9a,b).

28420170|t|To further examine the cytoprotective role of SIRT1, we examined whether the increased survival rate seen in fisetin-treated cells was dependent on SIRT1 activity. We pre-treated cells with sirtinol (SIRT1 activation inhibitor) for 30 min, followed by fisetin for 30 min before exposure to Tm (1 µg/mL) for 16 h. Figure 9c shows that the addition of sirtinol (15 µM) did not significantly cause cytotoxicity in PC12 cells in the absence of Tm. However, sirtinol completely blocked the fisetin-mediated cytoprotective effect against Tm. These results indicate that SIRT1 activity is involved in fisetin-induced cytoprotection.

28420170|t|3. Discussion
28420170|a|

28420170|t|Phytochemicals are being studied for the therapeutic usage in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Fisetin, a flavonoid existing in many different plant-based food products, has been reported to possess antioxidant, neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities by directly scavenging ROS or affecting signaling pathways in the maintenance of neuronal function and cell survival [25,26,27,28]. However, little is known regarding how fisetin affects signaling molecules in response to ER stress in neuronal cells.

28420170|t|We found here that Tm caused PC12 cell death. Addition of fisetin (5–20 µM) significantly reversed the cytotoxicity. We also tested whether fisetin could protect PC12 cells from another ER stress inducer, sesquiterpene lactone thapsigargin (Tg). It was found that Tg (0.3 µg/mL) caused 45% PC12 cell death and co-treatment with fisetin (5–20 µM) exerted a dose-dependent cytoprotective effect. The above results indicate that fisetin can prevent ER stress-induced cell death in PC12 cells (Figure S3). Furthermore, we also found that Tm (1 µg/mL) caused 33% adherent PC12 cell death, and only those cells supplemented with 15 and 20 µM fisetin could slightly attenuate the cytotoxicity, indicating that the cytoprotective effect of fisetin is valid to PC12 cells grown in both suspension and as monolayers on poly-l-lysine-coated plates (Figure S4).

28420170|t|Autophagy and apoptosis are cell death mechanisms with complex interactions between each other [46]. We found that fisetin inhibited Tm-mediated apoptosis, as indicated by decreased levels of activated PARP-1. Fisetin also decreased Tm-induced LC3-II accumulation and Atg12–Atg5 conjugate, indicating that Tm-mediated autophagy was also attenuated. Furthermore, our data show that in the absence of Tm, fisetin alone could protect PC12 cells from apoptotic damage. In contrast to the results observed for higher concentrations of fisetin, which induced apoptosis [30,31], this study is the first to document that low concentration of fisetin has anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic effects in PC12 cells under ER stress.

28420170|t|To dissect the mechanism underlying the protective effect of fisetin, we first investigated whether fisetin inhibited Tm-induced ER stress gene expression. Our results show that fisetin did not inhibit XBP1 splicing or eIF2α phosphorylation. However, it significantly attenuated Tm-mediated mRNA expressions of GRP78, CHOP and TRB3. Significant inhibition against GRP78 protein overexpression was also noted. These results suggest that fisetin down-regulated ER stress-target gene expression without directly affecting Tm-activated IRE or PERK signaling.

28420170|t|It has been reported that high concentration of fisetin induces ER stress gene expression in cancer cells [30,32]. We therefore investigate whether low concentration of fisetin alone could upregulate unfolded protein response (UPR) gene expression in order to conquer ER stress. Figure S5a shows that no XBP1s RNA could be induced by fisetin (5–20 µM) after 6 h treatment. It has been reported that fisetin (<10 µM) dose- and time-dependently induces ATF4 expression in immortalized mouse hippocampal HT22 cells [41]. In concert with this, we found that treatment of PC12 cells with fisetin (5–20 µM) alone for 6 h caused modest stimulation with regard to mRNA expression of ATF4, GRP78 and CHOP following a hormetic dose–response curve, and the highest induction was found at 10–15 µM by 1.5- to 2.5-fold (Figure S5b–d). This suggests that the modest induction of UPR by fisetin alone may play a part in protecting cells from Tm-mediated ER stress.

28420170|t|It was reported that Tm induced ROS production in vitro and in vivo [40,47]. In the current study, we found that both fisetin and NAC, a synthetic precursor of GSH, can block Tm-mediated ROS production, as measured by the reduced DCF fluorescence. However, ROS are difficult to measure and prone to artifacts that can generate false-positive signals [48]. Many inherent problems, such as being oxidized by other reactive molecules, exist in using fluorescence probe H2DCFH to analyze H2O2 levels [49]. In addition, studies using antioxidants to demonstrate involvement of ROS [50,51] are not always conclusive. However, until newer ROS-detection techniques are evolved, a clear picture of Tm-induced ROS in PC12 cells will be lacking.

28420170|t|Nrf2 and ATF4 are critical transcription factors involved in GSH metabolism [52,53]. Therefore, compounds that upregulate both Nrf2 and ATF4 are potentially useful in neuroprotection through their effects on GSH metabolism. It has been reported that fisetin concurrently regulates Nrf2- and ATF4-driven gene expression, and increases GSH levels at both normal and under oxidative stress conditions in HT22 cells [41]. In accordance with this, we found that in addition to the abovementioned ATF4 induction, fisetin alone also stimulates Nrf-2-driven mRNA expression of Phase II antioxidant enzymes, HO-1, GCL and xCT in a hormetic effect.

28420170|t|Tm alone only weakly or insignificantly induced HO-1, GCLC and GCLM expression. On the other hand, xCT was stimulated by Tm alone more than 10-fold, supporting the notion that it was upregulated by both ATF4 and Nrf2. Fisetin treatment further enhanced HO-1 expression dose-dependently, and the cytoprotective role of HO-1 was confirmed by the addition of competitive inhibitor, Znpp. Fisetin also upregulated the genes involved in GSH metabolism in the presence of Tm. In conclusion, fisetin may exert a cytoprotective effect by increasing HO-1 expression and maintaining the GSH level via upregulating GCL and xCT expression [25].

28420170|t|We also found that fisetin activated ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and attenuation of JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation reduced its cytoprotective effects. Many studies reveal that the upregulation of HO-1 requires p38 MAPK activation [35,54,55,56]. In agreement with this, we found that SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), but not SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), attenuated fisetin-mediated HO-1 overexpression. It was also reported that p38 MAPK mediates cell survival in response to oxidative stress via induction of other Phase II antioxidant enzymes [57]. Inhibition of fisetin-activated p38 MAPK also strongly enhanced expression of ER stress-induced apoptotic CHOP, and a less prominent effect was found for those cells treated with JNK inhibitor. The above results suggest that fisetin-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and to a lesser extent, JNK phosphorylation, may both confer adaptive responses to resist Tm-mediated ER stress and cytotoxicity.

We found that fisetin reversed Tm-inhibited SIRT1 expression in PC12 cells. In the presence of SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol, no fisetin-mediated cytoprotective effect could be observed. These results indicate that fisetin suppresses neuronal toxicity, possibly via modulating SIRT1 activation and expression.

28420170|a|

28420170|t|Illustra RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare) was used for preparation of total RNA. High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to prepare cDNA from 1 µg RNA. Real-time PCR (StepOne Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems) was performed with 2 µL of the cDNA, 200 nM primers (Table 2) and Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in 25 µL reaction mixture. The amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 60 s. Target gene expression was measured and normalized to the respective β-actin expression level. The identity and purity of the amplified product was checked through analysis of the melting curve carried out at the end of amplification. Relative expression was evaluated with the ΔΔCt method.

28420170|t|5. Conclusions
28420170|a|

28420170|t|Fisetin (5–20 µM) protected PC12 cells from Tm-induced cell death. Fisetin mitigated Tm-mediated apoptosis, autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Its cytoprotective effects were likely associated with modulation of UPR and resulted in down-regulation of ER stress target genes, GRP78, CHOP, and TRB3. Furthermore, treatment of cells with fisetin induced expression of Nrf2 target genes, HO-1, GCLC, GCLM and xCT. Fisetin restored SIRT1 expression and enhanced MAPK activation, which may confer an adaptive response to modulate Tm-mediated stress responses and cytotoxicity.

28738894|a|

28738894|t|Few epidemiological studies have investigated the link between occupational exposure to solvents and head and neck cancer risk, and available findings are sparse and inconsistent.

28738894|a|

28738894|t|Methods
28738894|a|

28738894|t|We analyzed data from 4637 men (1857 cases and 2780 controls) included in a population-based case-control study, ICARE (France). Occupational exposure to five chlorinated solvents (perchloroethylene [PCE], trichloroethylene [TCE], methylene chloride [MC], chloroform [CF], and carbon tetrachloride [CT]) was assessed through job-exposure matrices. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, asbestos exposure, and other potential confounders.

28738894|t|Results
28738894|a|

28738894|t|We observed no association between chlorinated solvent exposure and head and neck cancer risk, despite a non-significant increase in risk among subjects who had the highest cumulative level of exposure to PCE, (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 0.68 to 4.82). In subsite analysis, the risk of laryngeal cancer increased with cumulative exposure to PCE (p for trend = 0.04). The OR was 3.86 (95% CI = 1.30 to 11.48) for those exposed to the highest levels of PCE. A non-significant elevated risk of hypopharyngeal cancer was also observed in subjects exposed to the highest levels of MC (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 0.98 to 5.85).

28738894|t|Background
28738894|a|

28738894|t|Until recently, chlorinated solvents have been widely used in practically all branches of modern industry. Their use has since decreased in response to various factors, including increasing knowledge pertaining to their toxicity and environmental impact [–]. Several chlorinated solvents are known or suspected carcinogens. Commonly used for metal cleaning and degreasing, trichloroethylene (TCE) was classified in 2012 as carcinogenic for humans (group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), based on sufficient evidence that it causes kidney cancer and limited evidence for liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) []. The same year, perchloroethylene (PCE), widely used in the dry cleaning sector, was classified as a probable carcinogen (group 2A), based on limited evidence of an increased risk of bladder cancer []. More recently, methylene chloride (MC) was also classified as a probable carcinogen (group 2A) based on limited evidence that it causes biliary tract cancer and NHL []. Moreover, chloroform (CF) and carbon tetrachloride (CT) are considered to be possibly carcinogenic (group 2B) [].

28738894|t|Few epidemiological studies have examined the link between occupational exposure to chlorinated solvents and head and neck cancer risk, and available findings are sparse and inconsistent. Cohort studies could not control for smoking and alcohol use and lacked statistical power to detect moderate increases in risk, because they were often conducted in countries where the incidence of head and neck cancer is low. However, non-significant increases in the risk of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer were found in several cohorts of workers exposed to TCE or PCE [, ]. Case-control studies included proper adjustment for confounders, but exposure to solvents was often not well characterized. Exposure to solvents in general has been found to be associated with oral and pharyngeal [] or laryngeal and hypopharyngeal [] cancer risk, although others did not find an association []. Shangina et al. found a significantly increased risk of laryngeal cancer associated with chlorinated solvent exposure [] and Vaughan et al. found a non-significant increased risk of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer among subjects exposed to PCE [].

28738894|t|No study has yet examined the association between exposure to several specific chlorinated solvents and head and neck cancer risk, by cancer site. In a previous analysis of our study population by occupation, we observed increased risks of head and neck cancer in dry cleaners and metal workers, suggesting a possible role of exposure to chlorinated solvents []. Here, our objective was to investigate the association between exposure to five chlorinated solvents and head and neck cancer risk, using data from a large population-based case-control study, the ICARE study.

28738894|t|Study design and population
28738894|a|

28738894|t|The ICARE study is a French multicenter, population-based case-control study, conducted between 2001 and 2007 in ten geographical areas covered by a cancer registry. The study design has been described in detail elsewhere []. Incident cases of head and neck cancers were identified in almost all healthcare establishments in each area, in collaboration with the cancer registries. All new patients with histologically confirmed primitive tumors of the oral cavity, pharynx, sinonasal cavities, and larynx (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3rd revision (ICD-O-3) codes C00-C14; C30-C32), between 18 and 75 years old, who were diagnosed during the study period, were eligible for the study. Selection of the control population was made by incidence density sampling. Controls were frequency-matched to cases by gender and age (<40, 40–54, 55–64, ≥ 65 years old) and further stratification was performed to match the socioeconomic distribution of controls and that of the general population. Among the 4047 eligible head and neck cancer cases, 596 (14.7%) patients could not be located, 299 (7.4%) died before the interview, and 225 (5.6%) could not be interviewed due to poor health. Among the 2927 potential subjects who were contacted, 2415 (82.5%) agreed to participate and were interviewed, on average, within three months of diagnosis [, ]. The present study was restricted to men, as women were analyzed separately [], and to squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity (Codes of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3): oral cavity (C00.3–9; C02.0–3; C03.0–1; C03.9, C04.0–1; C04.8–9; C05.0; C06.0–2; C06.8–9),oropharynx (C01.9; C02.4; C05.1–2; C09.0–1; C09.8–9; C10.0–4; C10.8–9), hypopharynx (C12.9; C13.0–2; C13.8; C13.9), oral cavity or pharynx not otherwise specified or overlapping (C02.8, C02.9, C05.8, C05.9, C14.0, C14.2, C14.8) and larynx (C32.0–3; C 32.8–9). Overall, 1857 male cases (350 with oral cavity cancers, 543 with oropharyngeal cancers, 383 with hypopharyngeal cancers, 454 with laryngeal cancers, 127 with cancer of the oral cavity or pharynx not otherwise specified or overlapping) and 2780 male controls were included.

28738894|a|

28738894|t|Trained interviewers conducted face to face interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Data included sociodemographic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption history, and a detailed lifetime occupational history, which covered all jobs held for at least one month. For subjects who had difficulty answering because of sickness or tiredness, a shorter version of the questionnaire was used for either in-person interview or to interview a next-of-kin. This shorter version included mainly information on smoking, alcohol consumption, and occupational history and was used for 11% of the cases and 2% of the controls. Occupations and branches of industry were coded by trained coders, blinded to the case-control status of the subjects, according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) [] and the French Nomenclature of Activities (NAF) [].

28738894|t|Assessment of occupational exposure
28738894|a|

28738894|t|Occupational exposure to TCE, PCE, MC, CF and CT was assessed using job-exposure matrices (JEMs), developed in the context of the Matgéné program []. For each combination of ISCO and NAF codes, the JEMs provided three indices of exposure: (i) the probability of exposure expressed as the percentage of exposed workers (categorized into not exposed, 1–10,11–20,21–30, up to 91–100%), (ii) the intensity of exposure (for PCE, TCE and MC: not exposed, 5–25, 26–50, 51–100, >100 ppm; for CT and CF: not exposed, very low, low, medium, and high) and (iii) the frequency of exposure (not exposed, 1–10, 11–20, 21–30, up to 91–100% of working time). In addition, a specific JEM assessed the probability of exposure to at least one of these five chlorinated solvents, together with the average level of exposure during a usual working day. Exposure indices were provided for different calendar periods (1950–1969, 1970–1984, 1985–1994, >1995) to account for changes in working practices and regulation over time. As an example, in France, for methylene chloride, exposure limits decreased from 100 ppm in 1985 to 50 ppm in 1995, and a general improvement in working conditions was assumed to occur at the beginning of the 1970’s. After linking these indices with lifetime occupational history, the following exposure variables were obtained for each subject: ‘ever/never’ exposed to a specific chlorinated solvent (‘ever’ defined as having worked in at least one job with a probability of exposure greater than zero), total duration of exposure, and cumulative exposure index (CEI). CEIs were calculated by summing the product of the exposure probability, frequency, intensity, and duration of each job period, over the entire work history, using the central value of the classes. For exposure to at least one solvent, as the JEM provides the average level and the probability of exposure, the CEI was calculated by summing the product of exposure probability, average level and duration. We then categorized these variables. The duration of exposure to solvents was categorized into four classes: ‘never exposed’, and three categories according to approximate tertiles of the distribution among exposed controls, ‘short’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘long’ exposure. To examine potential effects of the highest exposures to chlorinated solvents, CEIs were categorized as follows: ‘never exposed’, and three categories according to the percentiles of the distribution among exposed controls (low: < 50th; medium: 50th–90th; high: > 90th). The CEI categories “medium” and “high” for exposure to CF and CT were combined because of the small number of subjects in these groups.

28738894|t|Covariates included age at interview in categories [years] (< 40; [40–49]; [50–59]; [60–69]; ≥ 70), area of residence, alcohol consumption in categories [glasses/day] (< 0.03: occasional consumption; [0.03–2.00]; [2.01–5.00]; [5.01–8.00]; [8.01–12.00]; > 12), daily amount of tobacco in categories [g/day] (0; [0–10] [11–20]; [21–25]; ≥ 25), duration of tobacco smoking in categories [years] (0; [0–20]; [21–30]; [31–40]; ≥ 40), smoking status (‘never’, ‘former’ [time since stopping smoking >2 years before the interview], and ‘current’ [time since stopping smoking ≤2 years before the interview]). We also fitted models with and without cumulative asbestos exposure in four categories (never exposed, and tertiles according to the distribution among exposed controls).As the inclusion of asbestos exposure resulted in changes in ORs for most solvents and no change in OR point estimate without loss of precision for the others, we present below the models adjusted for asbestos exposure (to assess the magnitude of confounding, OR estimates without adjustment for asbestos are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1).

Finally, to determine whether joint-exposure to several chlorinated solvents was associated with head and neck cancer risk, we examined the risk associated with combinations of chlorinated solvents with sufficient numbers (at least 10 exposed cases), using “never exposed to any chlorinated solvents” as the reference category.

28738894|t|For each solvent, we also assessed potential interactions with smoking, alcohol drinking and asbestos exposure by including cross-product terms in the models. None of the interactions were statistically significant, and the results were not presented.

28738894|t|Concerning lifetime exposure to chlorinated solvents, the most prevalent exposure was to TCE with 8.76% of cases and 7.53% of controls exposed followed by MC with 1.43% of cases and 1.14% of controls exposed. The prevalence of exposure to PCE, CF, and CT was lower with 0.44%, 0.09%, and 0.06% of cases, and 0.28%, 0.16%, and 0.09% of controls, respectively. Exposures to solvents were correlated, and were also correlated with exposure to asbestos (Additional File 1: Fig. S1).

28738894|t|Analysis of specific head and neck cancer sites (Table 4 ) showed a significant dose-response relationship between cumulative exposure to PCE and laryngeal cancer risk (p for trend = 0.04), and subjects who had the highest cumulative levels of exposure to PCE had a significantly higher risk of laryngeal cancer (OR = 3.86; 95% CI = [1.30 to 11.48]). The OR was lower than 1 in the medium exposure category, but the confidence intervals around each OR were wide. We used restricted cubic splines (4 knots) to verify the linearity assumption, and no significant departure from linearity was found (p = 0.61). In addition, we observed an elevated OR (OR = 2.36; 95% CI [0.98 to 5.85]) for hypopharyngeal cancer among subjects with the highest levels of exposure to MC, although the trend was not significant (p = 0.22).

However, adjustment for occupational class and level of education for high levels of exposure to MC decreased the OR of hypopharyngeal cancer (OR = 2.08; 95% CI [0.86 to 5.04] and OR = 1.57; 95% CI [0.60 to 4.12], respectively).

28738894|t|We found no significant association between combinations of chlorinated solvents with at least 10 exposed cases and head and neck cancer risk, or specific subsites (Table 5). However, although we observed no increase in laryngeal cancer risk for subjects who were exposed to only TCE (OR = 0.84; 95% CI [0.63 to 1.12]), or the combination of TCE and MC (OR = 0.95; 95% CI [0.59 to 1.53]), the risk of laryngeal cancer was non-significantly elevated for subjects who were exposed to the combination of TCE, PCE, and MC (OR = 1.32; 95% CI [0.68 to 2.55]).

28738894|t|Finally, we investigated the association between PCE exposure and the risk of cancer of subsites of the larynx (glottis/subglottis, supraglottis, and other or non-specified). The OR associated with the highest cumulative level of exposure to PCE was higher for cancer of the glottis/subglottis (OR = 5.95; 95%CI [1.73 to 20.53]; five exposed cases) than for cancer of the supraglottis (OR = 3.96; 95%CI [0.72 to 21.78]; two exposed cases) or of other/non-specified subsites (OR = 1.76; 95%CI [0.19 to 16.12]; one exposed case), but the ORs were not significantly different.

28738894|t|Discussion
28738894|a|

28738894|t|In the present study, exposure to chlorinated solvents was not associated with an overall risk of head and neck cancer. However, high exposure to PCE or MC was associated with higher risks of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, respectively. These results suggest that these commonly used chlorinated solvents may have a deleterious impact on the upper respiratory tract.

28738894|t|Few epidemiological studies have examined the effects of solvents on head and neck cancers, and even fewer the effects of chlorinated solvents on these cancers.
28738894|a|

28738894|t|Previous epidemiological studies have most examine exposure to non-specific solvents. In a case-control study, after adjustment for occupational agents and potential non-occupational confounders, a higher risk of both hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer was observed for subjects ‘ever exposed’ to solvents relative to those who were not exposed []. Another study which considered ‘all chlorinated solvents’ as exposure, also reported an increased risk of laryngeal cancer, although there was no dose-response relationship []. To a lesser extent, various other studies have shown a non-significant increased risk of head and neck cancers when solvents were considered overall [, , , ]. However, direct comparison with our results is difficult as the solvent classes were not clearly specified in the previous studies. Indeed, few studies have focused on the specific effect of a single chlorinated solvent on the head and neck.
28738894|a|

28738894|t|Among the few studies that have investigated TCE exposure, Blair et al. found a standardized mortality ratio close to the null value for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers [], whereas Raaschou-Nielsen et al. found a non-significant increase in the incidence of oral cavity, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer among blue-collar workers exposed to TCE []. A pooled analysis of three Nordic cohort studies, also showed a non-significant increase in the risk of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers []. Similar findings were obtained in another study, which showed a non-significantly higher hazards ratio for death by cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx among male workers exposed to TCE []. Moreover, a non-significant excess of mortality from oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer linked to TCE exposure has also been reported []. No information on smoking or alcohol consumption was provided by these studies. In our study, we did not find any association between exposure to TCE and cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx after adjustment for smoking, drinking, and exposure to asbestos. An association between exposure to TCE and head and neck cancer risk was reported among women in the ICARE study []. In women, confounding by asbestos was minimal and adjustment for asbestos did not modify the estimates related to exposure to TCE and head and neck cancer risk. In contrast, more than 90% of the men exposed to TCE were also exposed to asbestos, and inclusion of asbestos in the models may have led to overadjustment. We repeated the analyses among subjects never exposed to asbestos (479 cases and 1159 controls), and found no association with exposure to TCE (OR = 1.06; 95%CI [0.66 to 1.70]; 55 exposed cases), even if the risk of head and neck cancer increased for those with the highest levels of cumulative exposure (OR = 1.40; 95%CI [0.48 to 4.06]; eight exposed cases). Among men never exposed to asbestos, those exposed to only TCE had a non-significantly elevated risk of head and neck cancer (OR = 1.30; 95%CI [0.74 to 2.27]; 36 exposed cases).

28738894|t|The rare studies that examined PCE exposure in relation with head and neck cancer yielded inconsistent results. Cohort studies reported no increase [] or a non-significant increase in the frequency of head and neck cancers [, ], but were based on a small number of cases, and were not adjusted for tobacco and alcohol consumptions. A small population based case-control study on dry cleaners that examined PCE exposure showed a higher risk of oral cavity or laryngeal cancers in subjects exposed to PCE than those who were not, with some evidence of dose-response and duration-response relationships for laryngeal cancer []. Although these results were not significant due to the small number of exposed cases (seven for oral cavity, four for laryngeal cancer), they support our findings, particularly for the association between occupational exposure to PCE and an increased risk of laryngeal cancer. Moreover, the ICARE study has recently shown that exposure to PCE was associated with an increased risk of laryngeal cancer risk in women [], and an increased risk of lung cancer [], further supporting a carcinogenic effect of PCE on the respiratory tract. However, there were no studies to suggest mechanisms underlying these effects. Several potential genotoxic and non-genotoxic mechanisms of liver carcinogenesis for perchlorethylene have been identified, but are unlikely to be relevant for respiratory cancer []. However, the upper airways are in direct contact with inhaled toxicants, and chronic irritation and inflammation may contribute to the promotion or progression of otherwise initiated lesions. PCE exposure may also facilitate the penetration of other carcinogens in the mucosa, although the lack of statistical interaction in our data between PCE exposure and other risk factors does not support this hypothesis.

28738894|t|Our findings also provide limited evidence of an association between exposure to MC and hypopharyngeal cancer. No other study has specifically examined the risk of head and neck cancer associated with MC exposure []. Only two cohort studies of workers exposed to MC reported results for head and neck cancer by subsite, and found either no [], or a non-significant increased risk for oral cancer [].

28738894|t|Our study has limitations that may affect the interpretation of the results. First, occupational exposure was retrospectively assessed, and the use of job-exposure matrices generates systematic misclassification, which is likely to be independent of case-control status. Such non differential misclassification could result in an average bias toward the null []. Second, the number of exposed cases was small for some chlorinated solvents resulting in large confidence intervals. Investigation of combinations of chlorinated solvents was limited for the same reason and it was not possible to investigate the association between exclusive occupational exposure to PCE and head and neck cancer risk.

28738894|t|Our study also has several strengths. The large number of subjects provided sufficient statistical power to detect moderate associations, and allowed assessment of cancer sites and subsites. Detailed information on lifelong occupational histories was available, allowing us to assess the level of exposure to chlorinated solvents and investigate dose-response relationships. We adjusted for major confounders, such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as exposure to asbestos. Additional adjustments for educational level, socioeconomic status, and exposure to other chlorinated solvents showed that confounding due to these variables was minimal. Selection bias, although always possible, was probably not an important issue in this study. The distribution of the included cases by age and cancer site was similar to that generally observed in France []. The lifetime prevalence of exposure to chlorinated solvents among our controls was close to that observed in a representative sample of the French male population [].

28738894|t|Conclusions
28738894|a|

28738894|t|In summary, our findings suggest that high occupational exposure to PCE may increase the risk of laryngeal cancer. Data from the ICARE study has recently suggested that occupational exposure to PCE also increases the risk of lung cancer []. Our results extend these findings by suggesting a likely carcinogenic effect of PCE on other parts of the respiratory tract.

28714882|t|Sphingolipids are characterized by a broad range of bioactive properties. Particularly, the development of insulin resistance, a major pathophysiological hallmark of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2D), has been linked to ceramide signaling. Since vitamin D supplementation may slow down T2D progression by improving glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity, we investigated whether vitamin D supplementation impacts on plasma sphingolipid levels in T2D patients. Thus, plasma samples of 59 patients with non-insulin-requiring T2D from a placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blind study were retrospectively analyzed. Once per week, patients received either 20 drops of Vigantol oil, corresponding to a daily dose of 1904 IU/d vitamin D (verum: n = 31), or a placebo oil consisting of medium chain triglycerides (placebo: n = 28). Blood samples were taken from all of the participants at three different time points: 1) at the beginning of the study (baseline), 2) after 6 months supplementation, and 3) after an additional 6 months of follow-up. Plasma sphingolipids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. At baseline and 6 months follow-up, no significant differences in plasma sphingolipid species were detected between the placebo and verum groups. After 6 months, vitamin D supplementation significantly enhanced plasma C18dihydroceramide (dhCer; N-stearoyl-sphinganine (d18:0/18:0)) and C18ceramide (Cer; N-stearoyl-sphingosine (d18:1/18:0)) levels were observed in the verum group compared to the placebo group. This was accompanied by significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) blood levels in patients receiving vitamin D compared to the placebo group. Taken together, vitamin D supplementation induced changes of the C18 chain-length-specific dhCer and Cer plasma levels in patients with T2D. The regulation of sphingolipid signaling by vitamin D may thus unravel a novel mechanism by which vitamin D can influence glucose utilization and insulin action. Whether this acts favorably or unfavorably for the progression of T2D needs to be clarified.

28714882|t|1. Introduction
28714882|a|

28714882|t|Today, globally, more than 415 million patients suffer from diabetes mellitus, one of the major health problems worldwide with increasing prevalence. By 2040, one in ten adults will have diabetes. Almost 90% of all patients will have Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2D), the most prevalent form in industrial countries (International Diabetes Federation, “Diabetes Atlas—the 7th edition”). The development of T2D is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic background and multiple environmental factors, among which vitamin D status has been identified []. The active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 vitamin D, calcitriol), is synthesized from cholesterol through a photochemical reaction to sunlight in the skin, followed by enzymatic conversions in the liver and kidney. Although it can be taken up partially by food, synthesis due to natural sunlight exposure in the skin remains the major source of vitamin D, which explains why vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in healthy humans []. Since it is more stable and highly abundant in blood, the first metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) is normally used to determine the vitamin’s status in human blood. Vitamin D deficiency is defined by 25(OH)D3 blood levels less than 20 ng/mL, and was found to be associated with an increasing risk for numerous diseases including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes [,]. In this context, several studies revealed that patients with T2D have lower levels of 25(OH)D3, which correlates with a higher risk for the development of T2D [,,]. On the other hand, vitamin D supplementation may slow down T2D progression by improving glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity [,,]. Mechanistically, vitamin D can influence the insulin sensitivity directly by (1) the stimulation of the expression of insulin receptor and (2) the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta or (3) indirectly via the regulation of calcium homeostasis [].

28714882|t|Interestingly, the development of insulin resistance, a major pathophysiological hallmark of T2D, has been linked to sphingolipid signaling [,]. Sphingolipids consist of more than 300 structural diverse molecules with a broad range of bioactive properties. Various members of this special class of lipids were identified as important mediators in the pathogenesis of several diseases [,]. Particularly, the role of ceramide for the progression of diabetes mellitus was extensively investigated in the last years. In general, ceramide inhibits signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor, e.g., insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt/PKB, and thereby blocks the translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 and induces pancreatic β-cell apoptosis [,]. In line with these findings, different studies revealed that the accumulation of ceramide occurs in the skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant humans [], which negatively correlates with insulin sensitivity []. However, another study failed to demonstrate enhanced muscle ceramide levels in insulin resistant and T2D patients, fostering ongoing discussions on its contribution to insulin resistance [,].

28714882|t|In the current study, we investigated whether vitamin D supplementation influences the plasma content of long chain and very long chain ceramides and their precursor’s dihydroceramides, as well as the degradation products sphinganine, sphingosine, and their 1-phosphate derivatives. To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating a possible link between vitamin D uptake and changes in plasma sphingolipid levels in humans.

28714882|t|The characteristics of all patients (placebo group: 28 (13 male/15 female), verum group: 31 (16 male/15 female)) included in this retrospective analysis are shown in Table 1. The median age of the patients in the placebo group was 60 years and in the verum group 62 years with a median diabetes duration of 7 and 5 years, respectively. The median body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m2 in both groups. As shown in Table 2, the blood cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were not significantly different between the placebo and verum groups at baseline. Further, treatment with 1904 IU/d vitamin D for 6 months did not influence the amounts of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides in blood compared to the placebo-treated group (Table 2).

28714882|t|According to the previous publication [], all patients included in the current analysis showed at baseline a vitamin D deficiency with 25(OH)D3 concentrations of 12 (8.6–15) ng/mL in the placebo group and 13 (8.7–18) ng/mL in the verum group. After 6 months of vitamin D supplementation, the patients in the verum group had significantly higher 25(OH)D3 levels compared to the placebo group (placebo group: 11 (7.2–16) ng/mL, verum group: 29 (21–32) ng/mL, p < 0.0001). After an additional 6 months of follow-up, the 25(OH)D3 levels were still significantly elevated in the verum group compared to the placebo group (placebo group: 12 (9.9–16) ng/mL, verum group: 19 (15–22) ng/mL, p = 0.0007).

28714882|t|Here, we could show by LC-MS/MS analysis that the plasma concentrations of chain-length specific ceramides and dihydroceramides, bioactive synthetic precursors of ceramides, in patients suffering from T2D were influenced by vitamin D supplementation. After 6 months of vitamin D treatment, plasma levels of C18dhCer were significantly elevated in the verum group compared to the placebo group (placebo group: 11.6 (5.21–18.9) ng/mL, verum group: 18.8 (10.2–24.5) ng/mL, p = 0.036; Figure 1). In line with this, the subsequent C18Cer levels were also significantly higher in the vitamin D-treated group compared to the placebo group (placebo group: 24.3 (18.5–32.1) ng/mL, verum group: 33.0 (26.7–39.4) ng/mL, p = 0.040; Figure 2). At baseline, C18dhCer and C18Cer were similar in the placebo and verum groups (C18dhCer: placebo group: 14.5 (8.86–33.3) ng/mL, verum group: 17.3 (13.6–25.2) ng/mL, p = 0.250 (missing data: n = 27 (placebo group), n = 30 (verum group); C18Cer: placebo group: 30.3 (24.0–46.1) ng/mL, verum group: 36.0 (24.7–39.4) ng/mL, p = 0.856). Interestingly, after 6 months follow-up, no significant differences in C18dhCer and C18Cer levels were detected between the placebo group and the verum group (C18dhCer: placebo group: 9.16 (3.82–23.5) ng/mL, verum group: 20.1 (5.60–26.3) ng/mL, p = 0.170; C18Cer: placebo group: 21.4 (10.6–32.0) ng/mL, verum group: 23.1 (18.4–35.9) ng/mL, p = 0.211).

28714882|t|As illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, all other dihydroceramides and ceramides remain unchanged after 6 months of vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, no differences between the placebo group and the verum group were observed in the plasma levels of sphingosine, sphinganine, and their 1-phosphate derivatives (Figure 3). In line with these findings, no significant differences in the plasma levels of all of the other dihydroceramides and ceramides, sphingosine, sphinganine, dhS1P, and S1P were present between the placebo and verum groups at baseline (Table S1) and 6 months follow-up after vitamin D supplementation (Table S2).

28714882|t|3. Discussion
28714882|a|

28714882|t|Beside the well-known effects on bone formation and mineralization [], there is growing evidence for pleiotropic actions of vitamin D via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that is expressed abundantly []. With regards to T2D, these extraskeletal effects are particularly evident for the immune system and endothelial function, with controversial discussions about the clinical studies []. Nevertheless, several studies showed beneficial effects of vitamin D on glucose status, as well as on insulin sensitivity and resistance [,,]. In line with these findings, we could previously show that vitamin D supplementation enhanced 25OHD in plasma levels, which was associated, e.g., with significantly lower HbA1c levels []. Vitamin D supplementation may therefore stabilize glucose homeostasis and help to slow the progression of T2D []. Here, we used a total number of 59 plasma samples from our previous study to investigate retrospectively whether the uptake of 1904 IU/d vitamin D for 6 months had an impact on plasma sphingolipid levels in patients suffering from T2D. Several studies reveal that sphingolipids such as ceramide influence metabolic pathways and the cells involved in the development of diabetes []. However, to our knowledge, there has not been any study yet about vitamin D’s effects on sphingolipid metabolism in diabetes patients. By using LC-MS/MS analyses, we observed that the levels of both C18Cer and its precursor C18dhCer were significantly enhanced by vitamin D supplementation compared to the placebo group. All of the other dihydroceramides and ceramides as well as their degradation products remain unchanged by vitamin D supplementation. In general, C18dhCer and C18Cer concentrations are known to be in a lower micromolar range in plasma and serum compared to very long-chain ceramides [], which is contrary in tissues such as skleletal muscle []. However, the potential of single ceramides to influence the progression of T2D seems not to be concentration but chain-length dependent. Overall, there is strong evidence that ceramide species exert different effects depending on the chain-lengths of the fatty acid bound to the sphingosine backbone. For example, C16Cer and C18Cer induce cell death, whereas very long chain C24Cer and C24:1Cer mediate anti-apoptotic effects [,]. In the context of T2D development, Sugimoto et al. [] suggested that enhanced plasma levels of very long chain ceramides contribute to the elevated glucose clearance observed in sphingomyelin synthase 2 knockout mice. The overexpression of CerS2, necessary for the formation of very long chain ceramides (C20Cer/C24Cer/C24:1Cer) [], led to an improvement in insulin signal transduction, as well as decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress and markers for gluconeogenesis in mouse hepatocytes []. On the other hand, the lack of CerS2, and the subsequent elimination of these ceramide species causes hepatic insulin resistance in mice []. Overall, these data reveal a protective role of long chain ceramides against the development of glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance. In many studies, elevated short chain ceramide levels have been linked to insulin resistence and the development of T2D. For example, Haus et al. [] showed that enhanced plasma ceramide levels in patients with T2D correlate with the severity of insulin resistance. The authors suggested that the activation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by short chain C18Cer and C18:1Cer may contribute to insulin resistance in patients []. In addition, it was shown that glucolipotoxicity induces β-cell apoptosis through the formation of ceramides with specific N-acyl chain lengths, such as C18Cer and its corresponding dihydroceramides []. Most interestingly, in a recent publication Wigger et al. [] demonstrated elevated dihydroceramide levels in individuals who will progress to diabetes up to 9 years before the disease’s onset. Therefore, the authors suggested that these lipids may serve as early biomarkers for T2D development. The authors also showed that ceramides/dihydrceramides positively correlate with glucose intolerance and negatively correlate to insulin sensitivity []. From our data, we can neither confirm nor exclude that the observed changes in C18dhCer and C18Cer upon vitamin D supplementation can influence glucose uptake, insulin resistance, and thereby the course of T2D favorably or unfavorably. Thus, further studies need to answer by which mechanism vitamin D supplementation influences T2D progression. One of the mechanisms may include elevated C18dhCer and C18Cer levels. In order to elucidate the mechanisms, we would dissect whether vitamin D can activate specific CerS. CerS2 and 4 are the most prominent isoforms in blood, which catalyze the formation of either C20-26Cer (CerS2) or C18/20Cer (CerS4), as well as their dihydroceramide analogs []. To date, there is no evidence from the literature that vitamin D can influence specific CerS isoforms in order to generate chain length-specific ceramides and dihydroceramides. However, since we found out that vitamin D selectively enhanced C18(dh)Cer levels in T2D patients’ plasma, CerS4 seems to be an attractive target for future in vitro and in vivo studies. Interestingly, recent publications shed new light on the shingolipids´ potential in T2D prediction. Wigger et al. [] showed the effect of vitamin D uptake on C18dhCer and C18Cer levels at the onset of T2D in humans. A large population-based study of individuals, some of whom later developed T2D [], shows a strong predictive power for 1-deoxySL levels, indicative of T2D development in the next 5 years, particularly in non-obese individuals. Together with our observations, this illustrates the so far neglected potential of sphingolipid markers in T2D.

28714882|t|4.1. Patients and Sampling
28714882|a|

28714882|t|In the current study, we evaluated retrospectively the effect of vitamin D supplementation on plasma sphingolipid levels of patients with noninsulin-requiring T2D from the city of Frankfurt am Main (Germany). Overall, plasma samples of 59 patients from a placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blind study were analyzed []. The study was performed in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Frankfurt University Hospital (21 January 2008, Reference number: 9/07, Protocoll number: EMD 28162-600, EudraCT: 2006-006180-23). All patients had provided written informed consent before their inclusion in the study. All participants were not treated with bisphosphonates, calcimimetics, glucocorticoids, phenytoin, glycosides, or benzodiazepine, before or during the study period. Further, all patients did not receive vitamin D supplementation for at least 3 months before the beginning of the study (baseline). At baseline, patients’ characteristics (age, gender, duration of T2D, body mass index (BMI)) were determnined and the participants were randomized into two parallel groups. During 6 months, patients received once weekly either 20 drops of Vigantol oil, corresponding to a daily dose of 1904 IU/d vitamin D (verum group: n = 31), or a placebo oil consisting of medium chain triglycerides (placebo group: n = 28) at baseline. Blood laboratory parameters (triglycerides, cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL)) were determined at baseline and after 6 months of supplementation. For the sphingolipid and 25(OH)D3 analysis at all timepoints, blood samples (1.6 mg/mL ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant) were centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min at 400× g and plasma aliquots from each subject were immediately frozen at −80 °C until assayed. The concentrations of 25(OH)D3 were measured by 125I-radioimmunoassay. The plasma sphingolipid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described below.

28714882|t|4.2. LC-MS/MS Analysis
28714882|a|

28714882|t|For lipid extraction, 10 µL of plasma was mixed with 150 µL of water, 150 µL of extraction buffer (citric acid 30 mM, disodium hydrogen phosphate 40 mM), and 20 µL of the internal standard solution containing sphingosine-d7, sphinganine-d7 (200 ng/mL each), sphingosine-1-phosphate-d7, C17:0 Cer, C16:0 Cer-d31, C18:0 Cer-d3, C17:0 LacCer, C18:0 DHC-d3, C16:0 LacCer-d3, C18:0 GluCer-d5 (all Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA), and C24:0 Cer-d4 (Chiroblock GmbH, Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany; 400 ng/mL each). The mixture was extracted once with 1000 µL methanol/chloroform/hydrochloric acid (15:83:2, v/v/v). The lower organic phase was evaporated at 45 °C under a gentle stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 200 µL of tetrahydrofuran/water (9:1, v/v) with 0.2% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. Afterwards, the amounts of sphingolipids were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An Agilent 1100 series binary pump (Agilent technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a Luna C8 column (150 mm × 2 mm ID, 3 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) was used for chromatographic separation. The column temperature was 35 °C. The HPLC mobile phases consisted of water with 0.2% formic acid and 2 mM ammonium formate (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile/isopropanol/acetone (50:30:20, v/v/v) with 0.2% formic acid (mobile phase B). For separation, a gradient program was used at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The initial buffer composition 55% (A)/45% (B) was held for 0.7 min and then within 4 min linearly changed to 0% (A)/100% (B) and held for 13.3 min. Subsequently, the composition was linearly changed within 1 min to 75% (A)/25% (B) and then held for another 2 min. The total running time was 21 min, and the injection volume was 15 μL. To improve ionization, acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid was infused post-column using an isocratic pump at a flow rate of 0.15 mL/min. After every sample, sample solvent was injected for washing the column with a 12 min run. The MS/MS analyses were performed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer API4000 (Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with a Turbo V Ion Source operating in positive electrospray ionization mode. The MS parameters were set as follows: Ionspray voltage 5500 V, ion source temperature 500 °C, curtain gas 30 psi, collision gas 12 psi, nebulizer gas 40 psi, and heating gas 60 psi. The analysis was done in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode.

28714882|t|5. Conclusions
28714882|a|

28714882|t|Taken together, we demonstrate here for the first time that vitamin D supplementation enhances the plasma levels of C18dhCer and C18Cer in patients suffering from T2D. These findings offer promising new approaches to understand the role of vitamin D for the development of Diabetes mellitus by influencing sphingolipid metabolism.

15774013|t|Gluten-free diet may alleviate depressive and behavioural symptoms in adolescents with coeliac disease: a prospective follow-up case-series study
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Background
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Coeliac disease in adolescents has been associated with an increased prevalence of depressive and disruptive behavioural disorders, particularly in the phase before diet treatment. We studied the possible effects of a gluten-free diet on psychiatric symptoms, on hormonal status (prolactin, thyroidal function) and on large neutral amino acid serum concentrations in adolescents with coeliac disease commencing a gluten-free diet.

15774013|t|Methods
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Nine adolescents with celiac disease, aged 12 to 16 years, were assessed using the semi-structured K-SADS-Present and Lifetime Diagnostic interview and several symptom scales. Seven of them were followed at 1 to 2, 3, and 6 months on a gluten-free diet.
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Results
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Adolescent coeliac disease patients with depression had significantly lower pre-diet tryptophan/ competing amino-acid (CAA) ratios and free tryptophan concentrations, and significantly higher biopsy morning prolactin levels compared to those without depression. A significant decrease in psychiatric symptoms was found at 3 months on a gluten-free diet compared to patients' baseline condition, coinciding with significantly decreased coeliac disease activity and prolactin levels and with a significant increase in serum concentrations of CAAs.

15774013|a|

15774013|t|Although our results of the amino acid analysis and prolactin levels in adolescents are only preliminary, they give support to previous findings on patients with coeliac disease, suggesting that serotonergic dysfunction due to impaired availability of tryptophan may play a role in vulnerability to depressive and behavioural disorders also among adolescents with untreated coeliac disease.

15774013|t|Background
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Coeliac disease is an under-diagnosed autoimmune type of gastrointestinal disorder resulting from gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. Non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and dyspepsia are common, but the disease may also be clinically silent. Diagnosis is based on small-bowel biopsy, and a permanent gluten-free diet is the essential treatment. Undetected or neglected, coeliac disease is associated with serious complications. [1-3] Depressive symptoms [4,5] and disorders [6] are common among adult patients with coeliac disease, and depressive and disruptive behavioural disorders are highly common also among adolescents, particularly in the phase before diet treatment [7]. Recently 73% of patients with untreated coeliac disease – but only 7% of patients adhering to a gluten-free diet – were reported to have cerebral blood flow abnormalities similar to those among patients with depressive disorders [8].
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Improvement in state anxiety [5], in behavioural symptoms [9], and in depressive disorders [6,10] may occur after the start of a standard gluten-free diet, and after a vitamin B-6-supplemented gluten-free diet [11]. In some cases, however, the more serious depressive episodes have appeared following the commencement of a gluten-free diet [6]. Mechanisms involved have remained unclear. Some studies have suggested the possibility of impaired availability of tryptophan and disturbances in central serotonergic function as playing a role [9,12]. In parallel with this, a significant increase in major serotonin and dopamine metabolite concentrations in the brain has been reported after one year on a gluten-free diet [13].

15774013|t|Subjects
15774013|a|

15774013|t|The study sample comprised all nine adolescents (5 girls, 4 boys; aged 14.6 ± 0.8) consecutively diagnosed with coeliac disease between January 1999 and December 2000 in the Department of the Gastrointestinal Services of the Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, in Finland. None of the patients had a history of, or current psychiatric treatment. Duration of coeliac disease symptoms and signs (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, anaemia) leading to a biopsy was 2.3 (± 1.5) years. The study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient and a parent.
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Evaluation
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Baseline psychiatric evaluation was conducted 1 to 4 weeks after the diagnostic biopsy, during the wait for the diagnosis of coeliac disease to be established by the pathologist. The adolescent and a parent were interviewed separately by an adolescent psychiatrist (PP) using a semi-structured diagnostic interview, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children – Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) [14]. Seven patients attended the follow-up visits with laboratory tests at > 1 to ≤ 2, 3, and 6 months after starting a gluten-free diet (Table 1). Baseline and follow-up behavioural problems were assessed with the Youth Self Report (YSR) [15] and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) [16], completed by a parent (Table 1), and depressive and anxiety symptoms by the 21-item versions of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). CGAS (Children's Global Assessment) served as a part of the K-SADS-PL.

15774013|a|

15774013|t|Coeliac disease activity was followed by determining serum tissue transglutaminase (S-tTGAbA) and endomysium (S-EndoAbA) autoantibodies [17]. Pre-diet blood samples for analysis of amino acids, prolactin, thyroid function [thyroxine (S-T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)], vitamins B6 and B12, S-tTGAbA, and S-EndoAbA were obtained on the biopsy morning, and subsequent ones as a part of follow-up visits, both after overnight fasting, between 8 and 10 a.m. All nine patients had amino acid concentrations measured at baseline, and five of them during follow-up (1–2 times). A blood sample (2 ml) was drawn from the ulnar vein into a vacuum tube for serum total and free L-tryptophan, and for other large neutral amino acids (LNAA). The tube was cooled immediately and stored refrigerated in ice until centrifuged. After centrifugation, the serum was frozen and stored at -20°C for 4 to 14 months (median 7.5) until its assay for the amino acids by a modified procedure described by Qureshi et al. [18]. All the samples were analysed in a single run, in Kuopio, Finland, and free and total L-tryptophan and other LNAA's were assessed as described by Tiihonen et al. [19].

15774013|t|At baseline, three adolescents (3/9; 33%) had a depressive disorder: two girls had major depressive disorder (MDD), one with a learning disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), and another with comorbid conduct disorder; one girl had the depressive disorder NOS. Further, one boy had a phobic disorder plus attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and another conduct disorder NOS. Four adolescents (44%) had no diagnosis.

Prolactin levels (Table 1) from the biopsy morning showed a positive correlation with BDI score (self-report depression inventory; r = 0.89, P = 0.001), and a negative correlation with the ratio of L-tryptophan to amino acids competing for the same cerebral uptake mechanism (CAA) (r = 0.68, P = 0.042), but not with free L-tryptophan levels. The sum of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA: valine, leucine, and isoleucine) showed no correlation with L-tryptophan or free L-tryptophan levels.

15774013|t|Two adolescents with conduct disorders, one a girl with concomitant MDD, did not adhere to the gluten-free diet and dropped out of the psychiatric follow-up. Among others (n = 7), a significant decrease in most of the problem and symptom scores of YSR and CBCL, and in BDI, BAI, and Hamilton scales was evident after 3 months on the gluten-free diet, compared to baseline (Table 1).
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Celiac disease-associated antibody titres had decreased in all by the first month on a gluten-free diet, and had already normalised (= S-EndoAbA titre < 5 and S-tTGAbA titre < 8) in 4 of 7 patients by 6 months. Boys had lower biopsy morning prolactin levels (mU/l; mean 972, SD 450 vs. girls mean 2126 ± 756; one-way Anova P = 0.032), but higher levels after one month on the diet. In the first month, the S-T4/TSH ratio (nmol/l:mU/l) reflecting thyroid function increased significantly (Table 1).

15774013|t|Discussion
15774013|a|

15774013|t|We observed that the majority of adolescents with coeliac disease had depressive and behavioural symptoms before their diagnosis, and that coeliac disease patients with depression (all girls) had significantly lower pre-diet tryptophan/CAA ratios and free tryptophan concentrations and significantly higher biopsy morning prolactin levels. Adolescents with coeliac disease showed improvement in psychiatric symptoms after starting a gluten-free diet, and this improvement coincided with a significant decrease in coeliac disease activity and in prolactin levels, and with a significant increase in serum concentrations of L-tyrosine and other CAAs. The increase in free L-tryptophan levels was approaching significance. The findings of this study – improvement in depressive and behavioural symptoms after the start of a gluten-free diet – are supported by the findings of our larger previous retrospective case-control study [7]. Although the results of the amino acid analysis and prolactin levels are only preliminary, they give support to the hypothesis that impaired availability of tryptophan and the possible consequent serotonergic dysfunction may play a role in vulnerability to depressive disorders among adolescents with untreated coeliac disease. A possible role for tyrosine and the brain's catecholamine metabolism (dopamine and noradrenaline) in these disorders cannot, however, be excluded.

15774013|t|The decrease observed in psychiatric symptoms took place regardless of the stress accompanying being diagnosed with a chronic and restrictive illness, and improvement was not explainable in terms of physical symptoms, since both in the present and in our previous study [7], the presence or alleviation of depression showed no association with somatic symptom severity. Our results from adolescents differ from those reported by Addolorato et al. [5]. In their follow-up study on adult patients with coeliac disease, a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms but not in depressive symptoms appeared after one year on a gluten-free diet. Although converging with the findings of Ljungman and Myrdal (20), the few symptoms of our adolescents with coeliac disease adhering to a gluten-free diet in our present and previous [7] studies are thus in contrast to the findings of depressive symptoms [4,5] and disorders [6] as being common among adult patients with coeliac disease, even during diet treatment.
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Since the free tryptophan and the tryptophan/CAA ratios in plasma determine the availability of tryptophan to the brain [21], our findings on depressive patients give preliminary support to suggestions of impaired availability of tryptophan as featuring in coeliac-associated depressive and behavioural disorders associated with celiac disease [9,12,13]. As we did not have a control group of healthy adolescents, we cannot say whether L-tryptophan or L-tyrosine levels or both are generally lower among adolescents with coeliac disease, as could be expected based on the findings of Hernanz and Polanco [9], who reported significantly decreased plasma tryptophan and tyrosine concentrations in untreated and treated children with coeliac disease compared to levels in controls.

15774013|t|In the present study, stress-induced biopsy-morning prolactin levels were significantly higher among depressive patients (all girls) and correlated negatively with L-tryptophan/CAA levels. This finding is only preliminary, but it is, however, interesting: Although disturbances in the central serotonergic system have been associated with depressive and impulse-control disorders among adults [see [22]], and children aged 6 to 12 years with a recent suicide attempt have shown lower whole blood tryptophan content [23], serotonergic dysfunction in adolescents with depression is still poorly studied. The prolactin hypersecretion response to the L-5-hydroxytryptophan challenge (L-5HTP) test reported among pre-pubertal girls with major depressive disorder [24] and among healthy children at high risk for major depressive disorder (= high family loading for major depression) [25], may be consistent with dysregulation of the central serotonergic system in childhood major depression [24]. Moreover, alterations in neuroendocrine responses to L-5HTP challenge tests, such as the prolactin hypersecretion and hyposecretion of cortisol found in healthy children, have been suggested to represent a trait marker for depression in children [25]. Thus, the high biopsy morning prolactin levels in depressed adolescents with untreated coeliac disease in the present study could be associated with serotonergic dysfunction. They could also be associated with dopaminergic dysfunction due to impaired availability of tyrosine, since dopamine is known to exert an inhibitory action on prolactin release in the hypothalamus [26]. In the present study, however, pre-diet prolactin levels did not correlate with tyrosine levels. Moreover, the function of the intestinal Catechol-O-Methyl Transferase enzyme (COMT) – known to play an important role in the peripheral O-methylation of catecholamines – remains unstudied in untreated coeliac disease. It is of some theoretical interest that reduced COMT activity in erythrocytes has at least once been associated with conditions such as primary affective disorders in women [27].

15774013|t|On the other hand, in the present study also non-depressed adolescents with coeliac disease had higher than normal biopsy morning prolactin levels. Significantly higher prolactin levels among untreated coeliac children (5–18 years) compared with treated patients has been reported by Reifen et al. [28]. They suggest that prolactin may play a part in the immune modulation of the intestine and could thus serve as a potential marker for coeliac disease activity.
15774013|a|

15774013|t|Our preliminary findings on amino acid levels in adolescents with coeliac disease with or without depression are unlikely to be explained by malabsorption, since pre-diet free L-tryptophan and tryptophan ratios were not correlated with the BCAA levels that reflect the level of protein nutrition. It is of theoretical interest that increased production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), known to be the predominant cytokine produced by gluten-specific T-cells in active coeliac disease [29], can suppress serotonin function both directly and indirectly by enhancing tryptophan and serotonin turnover [30]. Increased IFN-γ [30] and, for instance, such events as a stress-related increase in liver tryptophan pyrrolase enzyme activity [23], may lead to lowered tryptophan levels by the enhanced tryptophan catabolism induced by increased activity of the kynurenine-niacin pathway [30-32], even without malabsorption.

15774013|t|Conclusion
15774013|a|

15774013|t|The alleviation of psychiatric symptoms found among adolescents with coeliac disease after commencement of a gluten-free diet coincides with a rapid decrease in antibody titres indicating coeliac disease activity and in their prolactin levels, and with a significant increase in L-tyrosine and other CAA serum concentrations, and with a nearly significant increase in the free fraction of L-tryptophan. Although these findings are only preliminary, and more research is needed, they give support to previous findings on patients with coeliac disease, suggesting that serotonergic dysfunction due to impaired availability of tryptophan may play a role in vulnerability to depressive and behavioural disorders, also among adolescents with untreated celiac disease. And since diet treatment may alleviate psychiatric symptoms, and earlier diagnosis may have beneficial effects on psychological and even on neurobiological vulnerability to depression, the possibility of psychiatric complications of coeliac disease needs to be taken into account in differential diagnosis of depressive and behavioural disorders.

28989655|t|We report a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) system for the delivery of BKM120, an anticancer drug for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While promising for cancer treatment, this drug crosses the blood–brain barrier causing significant side-effects in patients. The DNA nanoparticle encapsulates BKM120 in high efficiency, and is unparalleled in its monodispersity, ease of synthesis and stability in different biological media and in serum. These DNA nanostructures demonstrate efficient uptake in human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells, and increased internalization of cargo. In vitro studies show that BKM120-loaded nanoparticles promote apoptosis in primary patient CLL lymphocytes, and act as sensitizers of other antitumor drugs, without causing non-specific inflammation. Evaluation of this drug delivery system in vivo shows long circulation times up to 24 hours, full body distribution, accumulation at tumor sites and minimal leakage through the blood–brain barrier. Our results demonstrate the great potential of these delivery vehicles as a general platform for chemotherapeutic drug delivery.

28989655|t|Introduction
28989655|a|

28989655|t|Targeted action of small-molecule drugs remains a challenge in medicine. This holds true for antitumor chemotherapeutic drugs, where much of their success has been hampered by off-target side-effects, poor pharmacokinetics and systemic toxicity. One effective approach to tackle this problem is the application of drug delivery systems that would protect the cargo along the administration route and direct it to its target site. Several delivery systems are currently being explored which include: dendrimers, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, protein nanoparticles, viral nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. However, many of them suffer from major limitations such as: toxicity, rapid clearance, complicated synthesis and particle heterogeneity. In particular, nanostructure size and shape have been demonstrated to play an important role in their biodistribution, circulation half-life, cellular targeting, efficacy and immune response.– With most current drug delivery platforms suffering from structural polydispersity, the generation of monodisperse nanocarriers with well-defined structures will be essential for their application in drug delivery.

28989655|t|Polymers are the most commonly used material for developing nanoparticle-based drug carriers. In particular, amphiphilic block copolymers that contain a water-soluble block, and a hydrophobic block, have been extensively used as building blocks for chemotherapeutic drug delivery. These molecules phase-separate into micelles that contain a hydrophobic core which can accommodate lipophilic drug molecules and alter their kinetics both in vitro and in vivo., In recent years, a new class of amphiphilic block copolymers has also emerged which contains a hydrophobic synthetic polymer attached to a hydrophilic DNA segment, called DNA–polymer hybrids. These molecules can self-assemble into a wide-range of morphologies, including spherical micellar particles that expose a hydrophilic DNA shell and a hydrophobic core., A particularly successful example of such assemblies are spherical nucleic acids (SNAs). These structures are composed of a gold nanoparticle core and a corona of tightly packed DNA strands. SNAs have shown efficient cellular penetration and gene silencing ability both in vitro and in vivo.–

28989655|t|Recently, we reported a highly efficient and versatile method to generate DNA–polymer conjugates via solid-phase synthesis. Unlike conventional synthetic polymer chemistry, this method yields DNA–polymer conjugates that are fully monodisperse and sequence-defined. This class of material self-assembles spontaneously to generate highly monodisperse spherical micellar DNA nanoparticles in aqueous solution. Several examples in recent years have emerged demonstrating the suitability of DNA nanostructures in mimicking biological systems,, construction of nanoelectronics and nanophotonics, and delivery of cancer therapeutics. Compared to DNA nanostructures, such as DNA origami, which require a large number of unique DNA strands to generate the designed structure, limiting their use in large-scale applications, micellar DNA nanoparticles are composed of only a single DNA–polymer conjugate strand. This type of hybrid strand also offers advantages over other block copolymers in that the DNA portion can be highly functional and programmable in the final structure. Additionally, the poly-phosphodiester units in both the oligonucleotide and hydrophobic portions of the DNA–polymer strands are biocompatible and biodegradable making them suitable for biological applications. Particles of self-assembled DNA–polymer conjugates expose a ssDNA corona, and have been used in ligand targeting,,, delivery of anti-sense oligonucleotides,– DNA detection, formation of higher order assemblies,, and templating organic reactions., In particular, these DNA particles have shown great potential in cancer therapy.,, However, the exploration of these structures for cancer therapy has only been limited to in vitro cell studies. Our interest also focuses on cancer therapy, specifically, the development of a DNA nanoparticle delivery system for BKM120, an anticancer drug towards the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).

28989655|t|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) remains the most common type of leukemia with an incidence rate of approx. 4/100 000 people in the United States. Current treatments of CLL include chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide and bendamustine), purine analogs (fludarabine) and immunotherapeutics (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab)., The current gold standard for treatment is through chemoimmunotherapy; a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR).– Unfortunately, none of these treatments results in curative therapy providing strong justification for investigating new therapeutic approaches for CLL. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been shown to be a critical component of CLL survival and proliferation.– The expression of PI3K triggers downstream cellular events that inhibit cell death by inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins.– This makes the selective inhibition of PI3K a promising approach for the treatment of CLL and a focus of many efforts to develop novel inhibitors targeting this pathway.

28989655|t|Buparlisib (codenamed BKM120) is one such example of a pyrimidine-derived selective pan class I PI3K inhibitor. This molecule has shown high selectivity and potency against class I PI3Ks. BKM120 has demonstrated high cytotoxicity in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro, and significant antitumor activity in human tumor xenograft models., Currently, this drug is under clinical investigation in advanced solid tumor and CLL patients. However, BKM120 can cross the blood–brain barrier and inhibit PI3K in the central nervous system (CNS), inducing anxiety, low serotonin levels, schizophrenia, and hindering its success for translation into the market. Hence, a strategy to effectively deliver BKM120 to its intended biological target without deleterious side-effects in the CNS would be a major goal for therapy with this small-molecule drug.

28989655|t|In this article, we report the development of a DNA nanoparticle platform for the delivery of BKM120. The drug-loaded structures are unique in their monodispersity, can be readily prepared and are stable in different biological media and in serum. We show the increased cellular uptake of these structures in HeLa cells, and the internalization of their cargo. The structures show minimal non-specific interaction with human serum albumin (HSA), a major protein component of blood. Moreover, BKM120-loaded DNA particles promote apoptosis in primary patient CLL lymphocytes and induce cell death when co-administered with doxorubicin in HeLa cells, without eliciting inflammation. Evaluation of this drug delivery system in vivo shows long circulation times up to 24 hours, full body distribution, high accumulation at tumor sites and minimal leakage through the blood–brain barrier. Our results demonstrate the great potential of these delivery vehicles as a general platform for chemotherapeutic drug delivery. We have previously shown that the DNA component of these structures is able to silence gene expression to a greater extent than DNA antisense structures alone, highlighting the promise of these DNA nanoparticles as combination small molecule and oligonucleotide therapeutics.

28989655|t|In order to construct a scalable and highly monodisperse drug delivery system, we generated a single type of DNA–polymer conjugates that self-assemble in aqueous buffer to form micellar DNA particles. These conjugates consist of a 19-mer DNA sequence attached to 12 dodecane (hexaethylene, HE) units (HE12–DNA conjugate, Scheme 1). HE12 units were appended to DNA by automated solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry. This approach offers monodisperse DNA–polymer conjugates in high yields and provides control over the length and sequence of the monomer units in the final structure. In our previous work, we showed that HE12–DNA conjugates self-assemble into highly monodisperse spherical nucleic acid particles (HE12–SNAs) in aqueous media containing divalent cations. These structures consist of an exterior DNA corona, and a hydrophobic HE12 core which provides a favourable environment for the entrapment of hydrophobic guest molecules. We also showed the encapsulation of a dye molecule, Nile Red, in the hydrophobic core of DNA nanoparticles. In this current study, we sought to test the encapsulation of a small-molecule protein kinase inhibitor, BKM120. We were interested in BKM120 because (1) despite its high potency, it suffers from deleterious side-effects in the CNS of patients. (2) The drug dimensions are compatible with the core size of the DNA nanoparticle system and (3) BKM120 exhibits an aqueous solubility of <1 mg ml–1, which makes it a suitable guest for our system.

28989655|t|Schematic representation of the synthesis of DNA–polymer conjugates and BKM120 encapsulation method. Phosphoramidite monomers are attached to the 5′ end of the controlled glass pore (CPG) in a step-wise and sequence-controlled fashion. The 19-mer DNA strand is first built from the support, followed by 12 dodecane monomer additions (HE12) yielding monodisperse HE12–DNA conjugates. Self-assembly of the polymer–DNA conjugates in the presence of BKM120 and subsequent purification results in nearly monodisperse BKM120-loaded HE12–SNAs.

28989655|t|To prepare BKM120-loaded HE12–SNAs, a solution of BKM120 in ethanol was allowed to evaporate forming a thin-film, which was then re-suspended into a solution of HE12–DNA conjugates in water, followed by the addition of assembly buffer and overnight thermal annealing (95–4 °C over 4 h). Thermal annealing was shown to yield less size-variability compared to overnight shaking at room temperature. Following the encapsulation process, the products were purified by size-exclusion chromatography and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) (Fig. 1a). The success of the purification method was critical to ensure complete removal of free-drug in solution. This was important for accurate determination of the nanoparticle drug-loading capacity and for further biological studies.

28989655|t|Data from RP-HPLC confirmed the encapsulation of BKM120 in HE12–SNAs in comparison to ssDNA and buffer controls. Traces were obtained at two different channels: a channel selective for DNA at 260 nm, and a BKM120-optimal channel at 320 nm. The co-elution of the DNA and BKM120 was only observed in HE12–SNA solutions, indicating the association of the drug with the structure. In the case of ssDNA, only a DNA peak was observed at 260 nm, reflecting the efficiency of the purification method at removing free drug in solution. The drug loading capacity of DNA nanoparticles was calculated from RP-HPLC data and separately confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1b, see Fig. SF5†). For HE12–SNAs, the loading capacity was approximately 29% w/w, where ∼9 molecules of BKM120 were encapsulated per DNA–polymer conjugate strand. The aqueous solubility of BKM120 in the HE12–SNAs was enhanced to 24.4 μg ml–1, compared to <1 μg ml–1 in water. RP-HPLC was also used to calculate the recovered yield following purification. In general, ∼65% of the amount of DNA–polymer conjugates was retained following purification (see Fig. SF5†). Additionally, the drug-loaded structures had a shelf-life of over 4 weeks when stored at both room temperature and 4 °C (see Fig. SF7 and SF8†).

28989655|t|Having confirmed BKM120 encapsulation, we then studied the in vitro release kinetics of BKM120 in HE12–SNAs (Fig. 1c and SF6†). BKM120 release was evaluated by monitoring the decrease in concentration of the drug from a solution of loaded structures dialyzed against 1× TAMg at room temperature over 24 h. It was found that HE12–SNAs release BKM120 at a slow and sustained rate with ∼40% of the drug retained after 24 hours (Fig. 1c). The critical micellar concentration (CMC), above which HE12–DNA conjugates aggregate into HE12–SNAs was also studied. It was found that HE12–DNA conjugates aggregate with an associated CMC of 0.5 μM ± 0.2 μM in the presence of 12.5 mM Mg2+ (see Fig. SF9†).

28989655|t|We then proceeded to characterize the BKM120-loaded products. The sizes of the nanoparticles were studied by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2). Data from AGE revealed the maintained structural integrity of BKM120-loaded particles with no observed side products (Fig. 2a). DLS analysis revealed a highly monodisperse population of drug-loaded structures in solution with a hydrodynamic radius of 11.8 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 2b). AFM and TEM images demonstrated that BKM-120 loaded particles were well-dispersed on surface, with calculated dry-state diameter of 28 ± 4 nm and 21 ± 3 nm, respectively (Fig. 2c and d, SF11 & SF12†). The structures also appeared to retain high level of monodispersity, despite slightly widened features. The obtained dimensions are in agreement with solution measurements by DLS. The slightly widened morphology could be explained by the deposition of these structures on the surface and drying effects. The drug-loaded nanoparticles seemed to lose their spherical shape upon deposition confirmed by the lower height (8 nm) and slightly widened diameter as calculated by AFM.

28989655|t|DNA nanostructures such as DNA origami and 3-dimensional nanoarchitectures purely composed of DNA, are typically assembled in buffers containing moderate concentrations of divalent metal cations (∼5–20 mM) in order to mask the electrostatic repulsion between DNA strands.– Deviations from this window of buffer conditions can have devastating effects on the structures, causing shape distortion, aggregation or total collapse of structure. This limits the use of DNA nanostructures for biological applications. In our case, the assembly of HE12–SNAs was also shown to be dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations, however, the main driving force of assembly is hydrophobic interactions rather than Watson–Crick base-pairing. With this in mind, we sought to test whether our system can withstand variations in ionic concentrations and preserve structural identity in physiologically relevant environments. Evaluation of the nanoparticle stability in different buffer conditions was carried out by DLS measurements (Fig. 3). We tested concentration variations of two groups of candidates; divalent metal ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) in Tris buffer (Fig. 3a and SF13–15†) and different titrations of Dulbecco's Phosphate Saline Buffer (DPBS with Mg2+ and Ca2+), a buffer used in cell culture (see Fig. SF16†). Data from DLS showed that HE12–SNAs could withstand large variations in ionic concentrations. At high ionic concentrations (18.75 mM Mg2+ and 2× DPBS), no structural aggregation was observed. Additionally, at Mg2+ concentrations as low as 0.25 mM (in 0.5× DPBS), the structures maintained their natural morphology with no observed disassembly. The structures were also compatible with a calcium-containing Tris buffer at concentrations similar to physiological plasma concentrations (∼1.2–1.5 mM). Only upon total depletion of divalent cations did the structures disassemble into monomeric HE12–DNA units (see Fig. SF17†). The enhanced stability in different buffer conditions can be partly attributed to hydrophobic interactions providing an additional cohesive force to preserve structural morphology.

28989655|t|We then proceeded to test the nuclease stability of our structures in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) solution at 37 °C (Fig. 3b, see Fig. SF18†). This was important because rapid nuclease degradation is a major challenge for DNA nanostructures as they are translated to the in vitro culture environment. We measured a half-life of 2.2 h for HE12–SNAs, which was 4.6-fold higher than the results obtained for ssDNA (28 min). This demonstrated the enhanced stability of our system against nuclease degradation and could be due to the dense packing of DNA creating a steric barrier. We further assessed the serum stability in phosphorothioated DNA nanoparticles, where the nonbridging oxygen in the phosphate backbone of the DNA strand was replaced with a sulfur. This simple modification resulted in nuclease resistance for over 72 hours (Fig. SF19†), and could be easily implemented in our system as facile strategy for enhanced stability.

28989655|t|The in vitro cellular uptake and internalization of HE12–SNAs were studied by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As a first step, we generated Cy3-labeled DNA nanoparticles (see Fig. SF20†). This was achieved by mixing Cy3–HE12–DNA (where Cy3 was attached to the HE12 polymer at the opposite end of the DNA) and unlabeled HE12–DNA conjugates in 25 : 75 molar ratios, followed by thermal annealing, 95–4 °C over 4 hours (Fig. 4a). This approach yielded highly monodisperse dye-labeled nanoparticles with the dye molecules embedded in the core. This was important as surface projection of a lipophilic dye molecule could alter the uptake profile of the nanoparticles through cell membranes. Following 24 hour incubation in HeLa cells, fluorescence data indicated the high cellular uptake of Cy3–DNA nanoparticles and localization in the cytoplasm in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4b). Several intense foci were observed indicating the high efficiency of uptake.

28989655|t|We were then interested in studying the internalization of encapsulated cargo. Knowing that BKM120 has poor fluorescence properties, we decided to monitor the uptake of a fluorescent dye, Nile Red, encapsulated in our DNA nanostructures (Fig. 4c, see Fig. SF21†). The encapsulation of Nile Red further demonstrates the versatility of this delivery system for accommodating different guest molecules, highlighting its potential application as a general drug delivery platform. HeLa (adenocarcinoma) cells were incubated with Nile Red loaded-nanoparticles, Nile Red alone or DNA nanoparticle control at 37 °C. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the amount of Nile Red uptake by HeLa cells (Fig. 4d). After 12 hours of incubation and several washing steps, analysis of the flow cytometry data revealed significantly higher intracellular fluorescence of Nile Red when delivered by HE12–DNA nanoparticles compared to low non-specific internalization of Nile Red control (Fig. 4d, e and SF22†). The higher uptake of Nile Red was also confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, where the dye was mostly observed in the cytoplasm in the perinuclear region, confirming high uptake efficiency (see Fig. SF23†). Taken together, these experiments suggest that the increase in Nile Red uptake is due to its encapsulation and internalization by HE12–DNA nanoparticles.

28989655|t|Based on the cellular uptake and dye internalization studies in HeLa cells, we were interested if the higher uptake of our nanostructures would correlate to increased therapeutic activity of the drug-loaded constructs. The in vitro cytotoxicity of BKM120-loaded HE12–SNAs was measured against human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by comparing a dose-dependent administration of BKM120 in DNA nanoparticles with naked BKM120 and DNA particles as controls (see Fig. SF24†). In the tested concentration range, HE12–DNA particles loaded with BKM120 showed low cellular death in HeLa cells. Based on these results, we then tested the synergistic effect of loaded BKM120 in combination with doxorubicin (Dox). Our platform acting as a sensitizer in HeLa cells also highlights the versatility of our system as a general drug delivery system for anticancer drugs. For this study, HeLa cells were initially sensitized with three different concentrations of BKM120-loaded particles prior to incubation with various Dox dosages (Fig. 5a–c). Interestingly, as illustrated in Fig. 5, the cytotoxicity of Dox was enhanced upon co-administration with BKM120-loaded particles in a dose-dependent manner. The effect was most pronounced at higher Dox concentrations (Fig. 5c). The reduced cytotoxic differences between loaded BKM120 versus its un-encapsulated form, is in part due to the lipophilic nature of the drug which can diffuse passively through cell membranes and cause cytotoxicity. However, we anticipate that this nanocarrier platform could provide advantages in the delivery of BKM120 and other chemotherapeutic drugs by altering their in vivo delivery profile. Additionally, the capability of functionalizing HE12–SNAs with targeting ligands could also limit some of the drug's manifested side-effects and provide a targeted delivery regimen in tumors.

28989655|t| In vitro studies on BKM120 have shown this drug to induce cell death in B-CLL cells and promote apoptosis. Thus, we asked whether BKM120-loaded particles can promote cell apoptosis. To address this question, we investigated the induction of apoptosis through Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay in primary patient Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes (Fig. 5d). Earlier studies have shown that stromal cells induce drug resistance and promote cell survival through secretion of chemokines and cell–cell interaction. Additionally, the bone marrow microenvironment has shown to prevent apoptosis in primary CLL lymphocytes by modulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. As expected, the stromal microenvironment model (BSM2 stromal cells) protected CLL lymphocytes from spontaneous apoptosis as seen with the untreated controls (Fig. 5d). We found that BKM120-loaded structures promoted apoptosis in primary BMS2 cocultured CLL lymphocytes from 3 different patients, 24 hours after treatment. To further confirm these findings, we monitored the cleavage of caspase-3, a catalytic step in the apoptotic pathway. In accordance with the Annexin V/PI analysis, BKM120-loaded particles induced caspase-3 activity in CLL lymphocytes; both in the presence and absence of BMS2, confirming their enhanced activity in complex patient cellular environments (Fig. 5e and SF25†).

28989655|t|To evaluate the potential immunogenicity of this delivery system, we investigated the effect of HE12–SNAs on TNF-alpha induction (see Fig. SF26†). TNF-alpha is a signalling protein involved in systemic inflammation. Higher levels of this protein indicate an elicited immune response. We tested our system in comparison to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a synthetic dsRNA (PolyIC) which have been reported to induce the expression TNF-alpha., It has also been reported that the time course of TNF-alpha induction shows a rise-and decline profile with peak elevation at 2–6 hours post exposure., As illustrated in Fig. 6, after 5 hours of incubation HE12–SNAs exhibited no systemic inflammation with very low levels of TNF-alpha induction compared to LPS and PolyIC. The effect becomes less pronounced at the 12 and 24 hour mark. This result supports the non-immunogenic nature of HE12–SNAs.

28989655|t|Nanoparticle interaction with serum proteins
28989655|a|

28989655|t|Previous reports have demonstrated that inert polymers such as hydrophilic polyethylene glycol chains improve the efficacy of encapsulated drugs by reducing in vivo opsonisation with serum proteins, mainly human serum albumin (HSA). This not only prevents the rapid recognition of structures by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), but also provides prolonged blood circulation of nanostructures and higher accumulation at targeted sites.– In our case, we hypothesized that the dense hydrophilic DNA outer shell would provide a surface unfavorable for binding HSA protein. HE12–SNAs were pre-assembled then incubated with a 5× molar excess of HSA for 2 hours at room temperature, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) (Fig. 6). Since HSA exhibits lower mobility on gel compared to DNA nanoparticles (Fig. 6a), an association with the protein should results in a gel mobility shift of the structures. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, following incubation, no interaction was observed between the DNA particles and HSA protein (GelRed channel). It appears that the outer DNA shell dictates the interaction between HSA and the DNA structures. In a control experiment, the micellar DNA structures were denatured by the addition of a solution of urea and depletion of magnesium cations prior to HSA addition, exposing their long aliphatic chains (Fig. 6b and SF27†). In this case, even at low protein concentrations, HSA was observed to strongly bind to the DNA–polymer conjugates. These findings suggest that the outer hydrophilic ssDNA corona limits albumin adsorption, and indicates that the DNA structures remain stable upon exposure to the protein. In addition, we used Nile Red-loaded particles as a visual tool along with gel electrophoresis to further confirm the lack of interaction between DNA nanoparticles and HSA (Fig. SF28 and SF29†).

28989655|t| In vivo biodistribution of HE12–SNAs 
28989655|a|
28989655	28	32	HE12	Chemical	MESH:D005030

28989655|t|To our knowledge, the in vivo behaviour of polymeric DNA nanoparticles has not been previously studied. With that in mind, we proceeded with an in vivo screening via optical imaging which would allow for real-time tracking and overall biodistribution profiles. For this purpose, highly monodisperse Cy5.5–HE12–DNA nanoparticles were prepared which contained the dye molecule in their core. This was achieved by mixing Cy5.5–HE12–DNA (where Cy5.5 was attached to the HE12 polymer at the opposite end of the DNA) and unlabeled HE12–DNA conjugates in 25 : 75 molar ratios, followed by thermal annealing (95–4 °C over 4 hours) (see Fig. SF30 and SF31†). Nanoparticle biodistribution was evaluated by fluorescence imaging, following intraperitoneal injection (Fig. 7a and b) and intravenous administration of Cy5.5-labeled structures measured over 24 hours (see Fig. SF32†). Remarkably, Cy5.5-labeled DNA particles showed full-body distribution with long circulation times up to 24 hours (Fig. 7a–c and SF32†). Control experiments using Cy5.5-labeled single stranded DNA, showed loss of fluorescence, most likely due to DNA degradation. Similarly, the dye only Cy5.5 sample showed immediate loss of fluorescence, likely because of its insolubility. In contrast, the prolonged fluorescence biodistribution of Cy5.5–HE12–DNA nanoparticles could indicate very slow structural degradation in the blood stream. This behavior was further observed with intravenous injection of Cy5.5–HE12–SNAs (see Fig. SF32†). Compared to Cy5.5–ssDNA which showed rapid decrease in signal after 30 minutes, Cy5.5–HE12–SNA exhibited a delayed decrease starting at 6 hours. These results also corroborate our in vitro experiments that demonstrate enhanced stability of these DNA structures under physiological conditions (Fig. 3 and 4), and could also indicate that the DNA portion of Cy5.5–HE12–SNA is more shielded as the nanostructure circulates in the body. Interestingly, at the 6 hour mark, the rate of signal decrease in both Cy5.5–ssDNA and Cy5.5–HE12–SNAs appear to be similar which could indicate that at this point, the DNA portion of Cy5.5–HE12–SNAs may be degraded, and the remaining Cy5.5–HE12 portion behaves similarly to the remaining Cy5.5 dye in the Cy5.5–ssDNA sample.

28989655|t|Further 3D fluorescence imaging, which highlights organ-specific distribution, indicated low levels of excretion (liver and kidney) (Fig. 7c). Notably, low levels of fluorescence were also observed in brain and lungs after 2 and 24 hours (see ESI video clips 1 & 2†). The biodistribution within the blood stream without accumulation in non-specific organs, particularly in the brain where BKM120 manifests side-effects, is important to decrease adverse effects observed during systemic drug treatments.

28989655|t|The next question was to test whether our DNA nanostructures could reach and accumulate in solid tumors. To address that, the biodistribution of Cy5.5-labeled structures was evaluated in a cancer xenograft model. In our hands, the success of forming CLL xenografts was hampered by the inefficient engraftment of MEC-1 (CLL cell line) into rag2–/–γc–/–mice. Compared to CLL, colon cancer xenografts formed solid tumors much more efficiently in our mice model. Therefore, HCT116 colon cancer xenografts were used as a model system to test the biodistribution of our DNA nanostructures. Previous reports have demonstrated that nanoparticles tend to accumulate in higher levels in tumor tissue, a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect., In our case, we measured the accumulation of nanoparticles at the tumor site over time following intraperitoneal injection (Fig. 7d). Cy5.5-labeled DNA particles showed a steady increase in accumulation at tumor sites for up to 24 hours (Fig. 7e). High accumulation in tumors was also observed under intravenous administration. As expected, Cy5.5-labeled structures exhibited higher diffusion rates compared to intraperitoneal delivery with accumulation peaking at 6 h (Fig. SF33†). The steady increase in accumulation of Cy5.5-labeled particles at the tumor site is predicted to translate into the same pattern of anticancer drug delivery by HE12–DNA structures, which will provide an important mechanism to minimize potential complications of this drug. Overall, the in vivo stability and biodistribution profiles of HE12–DNA nanoparticles highlight their great potential as a robust drug delivery system.

28989655|t|Conclusion
28989655|a|

28989655|t|We have developed a highly monodisperse DNA nanoparticle delivery platform for small-molecule chemotherapeutics. Our structures show effective loading and slow release of BKM120, and have a long shelf-life. The DNA nanoparticles are made of monodisperse, sequence-defined polymers units, they are stable under physiological ionic concentrations, and exhibit increased resistance to nucleases in biological environments. Furthermore, these structures demonstrate efficient uptake in cancer cells, and increased internalization of cargo. In vitro studies show the ability of BKM120-loaded particles to induce cellular death and apoptosis, including synergistic effects between BKM120 and antitumor drugs, without causing non-specific inflammation. Moreover, the absence of interaction with HSA can possibly protect the structures from RES uptake. Further investigation of the in vivo biodistribution of DNA nanoparticles demonstrates full-body distribution and long circulation times of these structures. Furthermore, the particles are not observed to cross the blood–brain barrier an important feature towards limiting the side-effects of BKM120 or any drug molecule with CNS off-target activity. The structures also show high tumor accumulation in xenograft models highlighting their potential for targeted cancer therapy.

28989655|t|Given our findings, HE12–DNA nanoparticles show great promise as delivery vehicles for chemotherapeutics. This initial work has demonstrated the ability to load drugs and protect them in different biological conditions, achieve in vitro activity in primary patient cell lines, and monitor the in vivo biodistribution of these structures in mice to understand their real-time trafficking and stability. Future studies on this platform will focus on adapting cross-linking strategies to enhance drug loading capacity, retention and structural stability in vivo. Additionally, taking advantage of the DNA shell, surface modifications such as targeting ligands and oligonucleotide therapeutics will be implemented. We envisage this system to see applications in targeted cancer therapy and delivery of combinational small-molecule and oligonucleotide therapeutics.

29250520|t|The synthesis of a series of ribose-modified anilinopyrimidine derivatives was efficiently achieved by utilizing DBU or tBuOLi-promoted coupling of ribosyl alcohols with 2,4,5-trichloropyrimidine as key step. Preliminary biological evaluation of this type of compounds as new EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for combating EGFR L858R/T790M mutant associated with drug resistance in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer revealed that 3-N-acryloyl-5-O-anilinopyrimidine ribose derivative 1a possessed potent and specific inhibitory activity against EGFR L858R/T790M over WT EGFR. Based upon molecular docking studies of the binding mode between compound 1a and EGFR, the distance between the Michael receptor and the pyrimidine scaffold is considered as an important factor for the inhibitory potency and future design of selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors against EGFR L858R/T790M mutants.

29250520|t|Introduction
29250520|a|

29250520|t|Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase activity, is essential for cell growth, differentiation, migration, adhesion, and proliferation under normal physiological conditions (Gschwind et al., ). However, overexpression of EGFR has been associated with tumor growth and progression in a variety of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer (Huang and Harari, ; Kris et al., ; Moore et al., ; Harrington et al., ). Therefore, regulation of EGFR has been deemed as an important strategy for the development of cancer therapy (Huang and Harari, ; Gschwind et al., ; Steuer et al., ).

29250520|t|First-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib that possess a 4-anilinoquinazoline scaffold, reversibly inhibit EGFR mutants (L858R and delE746_A750) as well as wild-type (WT) EGFR, resulting in significant disease control of patients with NSCLC (Figure 1) (Cohen et al., ; Cheng et al., ). However, drug resistance driven by activating mutation of the gatekeeper T790M residue in which the threonine group is replaced with the methionine moiety, greatly counteracted the clinical efficiency of first-generation TKIs against NSCLC (Ozvegy-Laczka et al., ; Balak et al., ; De Luca et al., ; Pao and Chmielecki, ). To address this issue, the irreversible EGFR TKIs (afatinib, osimertinib, WZ4002, and CO-1686) which contain a Michael acceptor moiety for binding covalently to the thiol group of Cys797 in the ATP binding domain of EGFR, were developed to treat NSCLC via the efficient inhibition of EGFR mutants (Figure 1; Castellanos and Horn, ). Among them, second-generation TKIs such as afatinib potently inhibited both EGFR mutants (L858R/T790M) and WT-EGFR without mutant selectivity, thereby leading to side effects such as rash and diarrhea (Dungo and Keating, ). In contrast, third-generation TKIs such as osimertinib, WZ4002, and CO-1686 bearing an anilinopyrimidine core, showed high potency and selectivity for EGFR L858R/T790M over WT EGFR, therefore serving as mutant-selective TKIs targeting EGFR mutants involved in NSCLC (Zhou et al., ; Walter et al., ; Cross et al., ; Finlay et al., ; Gray and Haura, ).

29250520|t|Considering the drug resistance is rapidly emerging for third-generation TKIs (Eberlein et al., ; Niederst et al., ; Piotrowska et al., ; Thress et al., ), design of EGFR inhibitors with new structural skeletons could lead to the discovery of novel types of TKIs against EGFR mutants such as the triple mutant L858R/T790M/C797S (Günther et al., , ; Jia et al., ; Juchum et al., ; Park et al., ). Based on the fact that most commercially available TKIs are ATP-competitive inhibitors for binding at the catalytic domain of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (Traxler and Furet, ; Grünwald and Hidalgo, ; Normanno et al., ), we envisioned that replacement of the phenyl ring on the right side of WZ4002 with a chiral ribosyl moiety would provide compound 1 as a novel type of carbohydrate-based EGFR TKI against the drug resistance involved in NSCLC (Figure 2). Here we report the synthesis, preliminary biological evaluation and molecular docking studies of ribose-containing anilinopyrimidine derivatives as EGFR TKIs against EGFR L858R/T790M.

All reactions were performed in oven-dried glassware with magnetic stirring under an inert atmosphere unless noted otherwise. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on precoated plates of Silica Gel (0.25–0.3 mm, Shanghai, China). The TLC plates were visualized with UV light and by staining with sulfuric acid-ethanol solution. Silica gel column chromatography was performed on Silica Gel AR (100–200 mesh, Shanghai, China). NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker Avance III 400 or Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were calibrated against the residual proton and carbon signals of the solvents as internal references (CDCl3: δH = 7.26 ppm and δC = 77.2 ppm; CD3OD: δH = 3.31 ppm and δC = 49.0 ppm). Multiplicities are quoted as singlet (s), broad singlet (br s), doublet (d), doublet of doublets (dd), triplet (t), or multiplet (m). All NMR chemical shifts (δ) were recorded in ppm and coupling constants (J) were reported in Hz. Mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies 6120 or LCT Premier XE FTMS instrument.

The kinase activity was evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, 20 μg/mL Poly (Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was precoated in 96-well ELISA plates as substrate. After adding 50 μL of 10 μmol/L ATP solution which was diluted in kinase reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT), the plate was treated with 1 μL of indicated concentrations of compounds (dissolved in DMSO) per well. Experiments at each concentration were performed in duplicate. Reaction was initiated by adding tyrosine kinase diluted in kinase reaction buffer. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the wells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-PBS). One hundred microliters of anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted in T-PBS containing 5 mg/mL BSA was added and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After the plate was washed three times, 100 μL horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000, Calbiochem, SanDiego, CA) was added and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The plate was washed, added with 100 μL citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5.5) containing 0.03% H2O2. Then 2 mg/mL o-phenylenediamine was added, and samples were incubated at room temperature until color emerged. The reaction was terminated immediately by adding 50 μL of 2 M H2SO4. Plate was read using a multiwell spectrophotometer (VERSAmax™, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 492 nm. The inhibitory rate (%) was calculated with the formula: [1 − (A492 treated/A492 control)] × 100%. IC50 values were calculated from the inhibitory curves.

29250520|t|Result and discussion
29250520|a|

29250520|t|The synthesis of 3-N-acryloyl-5-O-anilinopyrimidine ribose derivatives 1a and 1b commenced with 3-amino ribose derivative 3 that can be readily prepared from d-xylose 2 in 41% yield over six steps (Scheme 1; Shie et al., ). Protection of the primary hydroxyl group in 3 with TBDPSCl followed by condensation with acryloyl chloride using Et3N as base gave ribose derivative 4 in 92% yield (two steps). Treatment of 4 with HF·pyridine afforded alcohol 5 in 71% yield. When 5 was reacted with 2,4,5-trichloropyrimidine 6 in the presence of K2CO3 or DIPEA, almost no desired product was observed. Exhilaratingly, nucleophilic reaction of 5 with 6 employing stronger base (DBU) as promoter proceeded smoothly to provide ribose derivative 7 in excellent yield (92%). Subjection of 7 to the known aniline derivative 8 (Han et al., ) under the promotion of TFA in isobutanol at 100°C delivered 1a in 69% yield. Removal of the 1,2-O-isopropylidene group in 1a with TFA in acetic acid and water at 70°C produced 1b in 83% yield.

29250520|t|For the synthesis of 1-N-acryloyl-5-O-anilinopyrimidine ribose derivative 1c, β-ribosyl azide 10 was conveniently prepared from d-ribose 9 in three steps and 53% yield according to the procedures described in the literature (Scheme 2; Bonache et al., ). The acetyl group in 10 was then replaced with TBS group to give compound 11 in 85% yield. Hydrogenolysis of the azide group in 11 over Pd/C followed by condensation with acrylic acid in the presence of DCC and DMAP afforded a mixture of ribose derivative 12 in 43% yield (α/β = 1:1; α-anomer: δH = 6.00 ppm, δC = 81.4 ppm; β-anomer: δH = 5.95 ppm, δC = 87.2 ppm), which were easily separated by silica gel column chromatography (Numao et al., ; Bonache et al., ). After removal of the TBS group in 12α, the resulting alcohol 13 reacted with 6 in the presence of DBU to produce ribose derivative 14 in an excellent 93% yield. TFA-promoted reaction of 14 with aniline 8 led to 15 in 70% yield as a mixture of α/β anomers probably arising from the anomerization of the 1-N-acryloyl ribose derivative under strong acidic conditions (Boschelli et al., ). Finally, acidic cleavage of the isopropylidene group of 15 in the mixture of TFA/HOAc/water provided 1c in 80% yield.

29250520|t|Synthetic work toward 1-N-acryloyl-3-O-anilinopyrimidine ribose derivative 1d started from replacement of the 2,3-isopropylidene group of azide 10 with 2,3-orthoester group by treatment with TFA and subsequent protection with triethyl orthoacetate under the catalysis of TsOH·H2O, affording azide 16 in 76% yield over two steps (Scheme 3). Substitution of the acetyl group in 16 with TBDPS group and subsequent acidic cleavage of the orthoester group led to an inseparable mixture of 2-acetyl and 3-acetyl ribose derivatives 17 and 18 (77% yield over three steps). Treatment of the mixture of 17 and 18 with TBSCl followed by removal of the acetyl groups gave alcohols 19 and 20 in 83% yield, allowing for the separation of 3-hydroxyl ribose derivative 19 from 2-hydroxyl ribose derivative 20 (19:20 = 3:2). Nucleophilic attack of 19 on 6 required stronger basic conditions to promote the reaction due to the steric hindrance of the silyl groups on 19. As such, excess tBuOLi in dichloromethane under reflux was employed for this conversion, providing ribose derivative 21 in 80% yield. TFA-promoted coupling of 21 with aniline 8 generated ribose derivative 22 (69%), which was then subjected to hydrogenolysis over Pd/C and subsequent condensation with acrylic acid to afford ribose derivative 23 as single anomer in moderate yield (39% over two steps). Exposure of 23 to HF·pyridine in pyridine resulted in cleavage of the TBDPS group without affecting the TBS group, providing 1d in 68% yield.

29250520|t|In order to better understand the mechanism of this type of compounds binding to EGFR T790M, molecular docking was adopted to predict the binding mode of the representative compound 1a. The docking procedure was validated in advance by re-docking the co-crystallized ligand WZ4002 (Zhou et al., ) into the ATP binding site of EGFR L858R/T790M structure (PDB ID: 3IKA). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the crystallographic and docked conformation of WZ4002 is 0.57 Å (Figure S1), demonstrating that the present docking procedure was feasible in generating the binding conformation accurately. As expected based upon co-crystal structure of the anilinopyrimidine-derived inhibitor WZ4002, the anilinopyrimidine core of compound 1a forms a bidentate hydrogen bonding interaction with the “hinge” residue Met793 (Figure 3). The chlorine substituent on the pyrimidine ring could form hydrophobic contact with the mutant gatekeeper residue, Met790. The aniline ring is oriented to form hydrophobic interactions with Leu792 and Pro794 in the hinge region. Moreover, the acrylamide group attached to the sugar ring of compound 1a could form a covalent bond with Cys797 to achieve irreversible binding. The sugar ring acts like a linker to tune the orientation of the electrophilic acrylamide moiety that can covalently alkylate the conserved cysteine residue Cys797. For the 1,2-O-isopropylidene moiety in compound 1a, it could form favorable vdW interactions with residues ARG841, ASN842, and Thr854. Therefore, compound 1b without that protecting group on the sugar ring, displayed less potent bioactivity against EGFR T790M/L858R compared with compound 1a. Lacking of the Michael receptor, compounds 24–26 are unable to form covalent bond with Cys797 and thus displayed sharply decreased inhibitory activity against EGFR T790M/L858R. Compound 1c displayed no inhibitory activity of EGFR probably because of the long distance between the Michael receptor and Cys797. Although compound 1d also has an acrylamide group attached to the sugar ring, it showed no inhibitory activity probably due to the conformational alteration of compound 1d caused by the TBS protecting group. Briefly, it could be concluded that the distance between the Michael receptor and the pyrimidine scaffold has a significant effect on the inhibitory potency of this type of compounds. Employing the ribosyl moiety as a chiral building block for modulating the distance between the Michael receptor and the pyrimidine scaffold could pave a new avenue for future design of EGFR inhibitors against EGFR mutants.

29250520|t|Conclusion
29250520|a|

29250520|t|In summary, we have described a DBU- or tBuOLi-promoted coupling of ribosyl alcohols with 2,4,5-trichloropyrimidine as key step for the synthesis of a series of ribose-modified anilinopyrimidine derivatives as EGFR TKIs. Preliminary biological evaluation indicated that compound 1a displayed potent inhibitory activity against EGFR L858R/T790M with an IC50 value of 0.62 μM, and good selectivity for EGFR L858R/T790M over WT EGFR. Molecular docking studies revealed that the inhibitory activities of this type of compounds are largely influenced by the distance between the Michael receptor and the pyrimidine scaffold. As a novel type of EGFR inhibitor, the ribose-modified anilinopyrimidine derivative 1a might be used as a promising lead compound for further development of selective EGFR inhibitors to overcome EGFR L858R/T790M resistance mutation.

29439449|t|Metabolic Effects of FecB Gene on Follicular Fluid and Ovarian Vein Serum in Sheep (Ovis aries)
29439449|a|

29439449|t|The FecB gene has been discovered as an important gene in sheep for its high relationship with the ovulation rate, but its regulatory mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques were adopted to detect the metabolic effects of FecB gene in follicular fluid (FF) and ovarian vein serum (OVS) in Small Tail Han (STH) sheep. ANOVA and random forest statistical methods were employed for the identification of important metabolic pathways and biomarkers. Changes in amino acid metabolism, redox environment, and energy metabolism were observed in FF from the three FecB genotype STH ewes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) showed that metabolic effects of FecB gene are more pronounced in FF than in OVS. Therefore, the difference of the metabolic profile in FF is also affected by the FecB genotypes. In Spearman correlation analysis, key metabolites (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, aspartate, asparagine, glutathione oxidized (GSSG), cysteine-glutathione disulfide, γ-glutamylglutamine, and 2-hydrosybutyrate) in ovine FF samples showed a significant correlation with the ovulation rate. Our findings will help to explain the metabolic mechanism of high prolificacy ewes and benefit fertility identification.

29439449|t|1. Introduction
29439449|a|

29439449|t|A single major gene responsible for high fecundity of Booroola Merino was named the FecB by the Committee on Genetic Nomenclature of Sheep and Goats (COGNOSAG, 1989) []. Based on research studies from three groups, the FecB gene was finally located in the BMPR1B gene, which presented a mutation of A746G in its coding region and caused an amino acid substitution of glutamine into arginine in the protein sequence [,,]. In Booroola ewes, the effect of the FecB gene increased the ovulation rate and was partially dominant for litter size [,]. Monget et al. reported that the diameter of the ovulatory follicle was also significantly correlated with FecB genotypes [].

29439449|t|Since follicle development and ovulation in ovaries were found to be controlled by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) [], it was predicted that the FecB gene may impact pituitary glands by increasing the release of hormone or impact ovaries in follicular cells by increasing sensitivity to the hormone []. After many years of arguments, the majority of researchers agree that the FecB gene influences the ovaries by modulating the difference in the ovulation rate [,,,]. With regard to ovarian tissue, reproduction-related gene expression, transcriptomics, and proteomics were continuously studied in FecB carriers’ ewes [,,]. However, little attention was paid to the effect of FecB on ovine follicular fluid (FF), as well as the unique microenvironment which can provide energy, nutrition, and regulatory factor for oocyte development and ovulation. The message from compounds in FF may allow an oocyte to determine its own developing fate []. It is well known that FecB carriers permitted smaller follicles to develop into the ovulatory follicle []. In this study, we put forward a hypothesis that follicular fluid (FF) and its related ovarian vein serum (OVS) may present differently in their composition between FecB gene carriers and non-carriers. 
29439449|a|

29439449|t|For analyzing the quality and fate of an oocyte, metabolomics has proven to be a powerful approach for discovering the small-molecule biomarkers in FF and culture medium and has been studied in humans, cattle, and pigs [,,]. Wallace et al. and Bertoldo et al. found separately through 1H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy that the quality and developmental potential of oocytes for humans and pigs are related to metabolic profiles in FF [,]. Contrasted with 1H-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques have become efficient platforms due to their high sensitivity and selectivity [,]. In the present study, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques were adopted to discover the metabolic effects of the FecB gene on FF and OVS in Small Tail Han (STH) sheep. Our findings may help explain the metabolic mechanism of high prolificacy ewes and uncover some useful biomarkers for fertility identification.

29439449|t|2.1. Measurement of Ovulation Rate, Number, and Diameter for Pre-Ovulation
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Without any other extra exogenous hormones that may induce superovulation in ewes, ovulation rates of three FecB genotype ewes were successfully detected in 51 individuals using the laparoscopy procedure after treatment of estrus synchronization with CIDR (controlled internal drug releasing) (Table 1). The mean ovulation rates (total of the two ovaries) of the ++ (wild-type for FecB gene), +B (heterozygote mutant for FecB gene), and BB (homozygous mutant for FecB gene) groups were 1.06 ± 0.06, 2.29 ± 0.17, and 3.06 ± 0.26, respectively. Meanwhile, the comparison of ovulation rates between any two genotype groups all showed highly significant differences (p ≤ 0.01). 
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Before collecting FF samples, the diameter and number of pre-ovulation follicles were successfully measured in 56 individuals (Table 1). The number of pre-ovulation follicle in BB ewes with 3.00 ± 0.38 was significantly higher than 2.32 ± 0.38 in +B ewes (p ≤ 0.01). At the same time, the pre-ovulation follicle numbers of BB and +B ewes were all significantly higher than 1.29 ± 0.10 in ++ewes (p ≤ 0.01). However, the opposite situation emerged in the diameter of pre-ovulation follicles. The mean diameter in ++ewes with 7.56 ± 0.52 mm was significantly larger than 5.32 ± 0.25 mm in +B ewes (p ≤ 0.01), and the mean diameters of ++ and +B ewes were all significantly higher than the 4.20 ± 0.15 mm mean diameter in BB ewes (p ≤ 0.01). In summary, the ovulation rate, pre-ovulation follicle number, and diameter in STH ewes were greatly influenced by the FecB gene effect.

29439449|t|2.2. Overview of Metabolite in Pre-Ovulation FF and OVS Samples
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Compared with the authenticated standards library of Metabolon Inc., a total of 236 and 310 known biochemical compounds were identified in ovine FF and OVS samples, respectively. All the biochemical compounds could be classified into eight super metabolic pathways (amino acid, peptide, carbohydrate, energy, lipid, nucleotide, xenobiotics, cofactors, and vitamins). With the log transformation, ANOVA was separately adopted in FF and OVS experimental group comparisons. The significantly different levels of biochemicals (p ≤ 0.05) in each comparison were picked out for FF and OVS samples (Figure 1). Since the FecB carriers have more similar biochemicals, however, BB and +B groups were accompanied by different biochemicals when compared with the wild-type groups (++) for both samples of FF and OVS. Most of the different biochemicals in FF and OVS from BB_VS_++ and +B_VS_++ were common defferecese (40 and 39).

29439449|t|Based on differences in overall metabolite signature in FF and OVS samples, PCA and HCA analyses were adopted to determine whether the samples can be segregated as BB, +B, and ++ groups, or whether samples from the same group can cluster together. PCA of FF revealed a separation between the group of ++ genotypes and FecB carrier genotypes (Figure 2A). BB samples formed the least variable population and partially overlapped with +B. HCA of FF showed that BB samples clustered together, while +B samples formed four sub-clusters interspersed by non-carriers (++) (Figure 2C). PCA and HCA analyses were also performed for OVS samples (Figure 2B,D) and showed minimal group separation in PCA and more sub-clustering in HCA based on genotypes of the FecB gene. Collectively, these two assessments revealed that metabolic effects associated with the FecB gene are more pronounced in FF than in OVS.

29439449|t|2.3. Identification of Biomarkers in FF and OVS for FecB Gene Effect
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Random forest analysis was performed for FF samples and yielded a good predictive accuracy of 83% (Figure 3A); random chance usually yields 33%. The top 30 ranking biochemicals that contributed to the differentiation are presented in Figure 3C. The process involved redox homeostasis (e.g., glutathione oxidized (GSSG), cysteine-glutathione disulfide, and 2-hydroxybutyrate (AHB)), carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., maltose, glycerate, and mannose), and lipid metabolism (e.g., glycerophosphocholine, choline phosphate, and glycerol 3-phosphate). The same analysis performed for OVS samples resulted in moderate predictive accuracy of 63% (Figure 3B) and highlighted microbiome-associated biochemicals (e.g., 4-ethylphenylsulfate, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, and 3-indoxyl sulfate), compounds related to nucleotide metabolism (e.g., allantoin, N1-methylguanosine, and pseudouridine) and compounds related to lipid metabolism (e.g., 2-hydroxypalmitate, mead acid(20:3n9), and 1-linolenoyl-GPc (18:3)) as strong contributors to group separation (Figure 3D). Regardless of what the samples are, the class error of the ++ group in FF and OVS samples are the lowest group. The random forest model showed weak separation power between BB and +B while also having an excellent ability to discriminate the wide-type (++) individuals from the FecB carriers.

29439449|t|2.4. Changes in Energy Metabolism in FF

29439449|t|FF seen as the unique microenvironment of oocyte development could provide substrates to meet energy requirements. In this study, glucose 6-phosphate acted as a glycolytic intermediate, the TCA cycle intermediates (citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and malate) along with the glycolytic intermediate were elevated in FF obtained from BB as compared to ++ individuals (Figure 4). Citrate, in addition to being an intermediate of the TCA cycle, is also a substrate for fatty acid biosynthesis, while α-ketoglutarate can be used to synthesize glutamic acid. In addition, glucose 1-phosphate levels were lower, and maltose was elevated in FF from BB animals (BB vs. (++) comparison), which might indicate increased glycogenolysis or decreased storage of glycogen. Taken together, the changes observed here indicate that the use of the TCA cycle as well as possible biosynthetic pathways utilizing the cycle intermediates are different between BB and (++) animals.

29439449|t|The levels of several amino acids were higher in FF for ewes carrying the FecB gene (e.g., threonine, aspartate, asparagine, lysine, cysteine, and arginine) (Table 2). These phenomena might reflect changes in amino acid homeostasis and protein synthesis/degradation rates. As a result, higher levels of amino acids may provide a more nourishing microenvironment for oocyte development. Additionally, aspartate levels were significantly elevated in FF with increased FecB copies (p ≤ 0.05).

29439449|t|2.6. Elevation of Antioxidant Defense Capacity in FF for BB Sheep
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Notably, the level of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) for BB genotype in FF samples was 12.37-fold compared with the ++ genotype (p ≤ 0.01). Accompanied by a decrease in FecB copies, the level of GSSG declined (p ≤ 0.05) (Table 3). The levels of antioxidant defense compounds of cysteine, cysteine-glutathione disulfide, and γ-glutamyl-amino acid (including γ-glutamylalanine, γ-glutamylglutamine, γ-glutamylisoleucine, γ-glutamylleucine, γ-glutamylphenylalanine, and γ-glutamyltyrosine) were also higher in FF for BB and +B ewes vs. ++ (Table 3 and Figure 5). However, in both FF and OVS samples, 2-hydroxybutyrate (AHB) was all lower in ewes that carried the FecB gene. We speculate that increased antioxidant defense compounds in FF for BB ewes may have beneficial effects on more oocyte development.

29439449|t|Levels of pregn steroid monosulfate in OVS showed a trend toward an increase in BB ewes as compared to ++ (0.05 < p ≤ 0.10). Levels of cortisone also showed a trend toward a decrease in OVS from BB animals (0.05 < p ≤ 0.10). Cortisone is generated by the action of 11-β-steroid dehydrogenase on peripheral cortisol. Cortisone may thus serve as a proxy for cortisol release. In this case, lower levels of cortisone may contribute to differences in stress-mediated release between FecB gene carriers (BB and +B) and non-carriers.

29439449|t|Spearman correlation was performed to assess the relationship between metabolic changes and ovulation rates. The normalized raw area counts data, the Scaled Imp Data, and the statistical values of ANOVA and Spearman correlation for FF and OVS samples are presented in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Scatter plots in Figure S1 show the dependence between ovulation rate (1–4) and the level of some key metabolites (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, aspartate, asparagine, GSSG, cysteine-glutathione disulfide, γ-glutamylglutamine, and 2-hydrosybutyrate) in FF samples. The p-value Spearman correlation of these metabolites are less than 0.05, which means that a significant correlation and the correlations between ovulation rate and these key metabolite levels are about 0.5.

29439449|t|3. Discussion
29439449|a|

29439449|t|The discovery of the FecB gene, which is responsible for the ovulation rate and litter size traits in Booroola Merino sheep, assisted researchers in improving the fertility in other sheep breeds [,,]. After that, several major genes for ovulation or litter size traits were found and called fecundity (Fec) genes, some of which include FecX, FecG, and FecL [,,,]. Ovulation is a sophisticated process controlled by many minor and major genes [], and not all of the major genes found explained or worked well with regard to the ovulation rate in other high prolificacy sheep breeds. Therefore, for a long time, a variety of new technologies were adopted by researches to find new Fec genes. Nevertheless, no matter how powerful a Fec gene is, there is no difference in ovary metabolism between high and low prolificacy sheep. Equally, metabolism differences may provide another angle of view for reproduction-related gene discovery and understanding []. In the present study, FF and OVS from three FecB genotype STH ewes were selected for metabolomics analysis. Several metabolic pathways and key biomarkers were identified by ANOVA and random forest. We have verified the hypothesis that metabolites in ewes’ FF and OVS is affected by FecB genotypes. 
29439449|a|

29439449|t|It is well known that FF is the product of the transfer of blood plasma constituents that cross the blood follicular barrier (BFB) and the secretory activity of granulosa and thecal cells []. Owing to the perm selectivity, it is believed that high-molecular-weight proteins are blocked by BFB, and the low-molecular-weight compounds, which could be detected by metabolomics in FF, are supposed to be similar in the OVS []. However, our result showed that the metabolic effects of the FecB gene are more pronounced in FF than in OVS. A logical deduction may be accounted for this phenomenon: the effect of the FecB gene on the secretory activity of granulosa and thecal cells may be strong. Campbell et al. showed that the FecB gene affected the response of both granulosa and theca cells to BMP, gonadotropin, and IGF-I stimulation in cultivating ovine ovarian tissue []. Soyun et al. found that FecB is expressed in cumulus–oocyte complexes (CoCs) and the loss of FecB in mice is associated with defective cumulus cell expansion in vitro []. Based on the overview of metabolomics data in the present study, we can also infer that CoCs and theca cells, which are composed the follicles, were the prime location for FecB affection.
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Glucose is the major energy source for cells in the ovaries, and glucose concentration increases when the diameter of follicles increases []. Therefore, the follicles with smaller diameters measured in BB and +B can account for the lower concentration of glucose 1-phosphate, which stands for a lower level of energy storage detected in FecB carriers. However, as an intermediate of the TCA cycle, especially for α-ketoglutarate, which can be synthesized as glutamic acid, it was elevated in FF for BB individuals. Together with the high level of γ-glutamyl-amino acid and GSSG in FecB carriers, we considered that the capacity of antioxidant defense is necessary for high ovulation rate phenomenon in ewes. The elevation of antioxidant defense capacity in FF for BB sheep attracted our attention. Previously, many researchers also supported that antioxidant defense is highly correlated with oocyte developmental competence [,]. It is reported that low antioxidant capacity in FF accompanied poor oocyte fertilization [,,]. The levels of lipid peroxidation (a proxy of oxidative stress) and the total antioxidant capacity of FF have been positively correlated with pregnancy rates in human studies []. The increase in oxidative stress was associated with high rates of oxidative metabolism. Elevation in the antioxidant defense has been linked to compensatory mechanisms to counteract the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) []. In the current study, the increases in γ-glutamyl-amino acid, GSSG, cysteine, and cysteine-glutathione indicate the augmented antioxidant defense capacity of FF from BB ewes, which may have beneficial effects on oocyte development.

29439449|t|The levels of aspartate are worth pointing out, as they were elevated significantly in FF as FecB copies increased, which indicates that the correlation between the aspartate level and ovulation rate in Spearman correlation analysis is significant. In human pre-ovulatory follicles, an elevation in the level of d-aspartate has been observed and correlated with the quality of oocytes and a positive outcome of in vitro fertilization []. In addition, d-aspartate was shown to elicit endocrine functions in rats by increasing plasma luteinizing hormone levels []. In our research, it was not possible to differentiate between d- and l-aspartate using this global metabolomic analysis, and specific details need to be included in further study.

29439449|t|Steroidogenesis is critical for follicle growth and subsequent oocyte development. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol through a series of cytochrome P450-dependent reactions []. In a recent study, Foroughinia et al. showed that the expression of a set of genes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones, including Cyp19, ESR1, and ESR2, were closely associated with the number of antral follicles in ewe ovaries []. However, very subtle changes were observed in the levels of steroid hormones between FecB gene carriers and non-carriers. The levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in FF also did not show a statistical difference. This might be due, at least in part, to the fact that the compound in this study was below the threshold of detection in 25–38% of the samples from the experimental groups.

29439449|t|A number of microbiome-associated metabolites (e.g., 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate, indolepropionate, 3-indoxyl sulfate) that were unexpectedly elevated in OVS, also followed the same trend in the follicular fluid from BB ewes (vs ++). We predicted that the protein of FecB (BMPR1B) was also expressed in colonic epithelial cells, and aberrant BMP signaling was associated with polyposis [,]. Furthermore, disruption of BMP signaling in the mesenchymal cells of the colon (due to BMPR1A deletion) resulted in a toxic microenvironment with changes in extracellular matrix deposition and secretion of cytokines and growth factors []. Although the majority of reports focus on BMPR1A signaling in the gut, it is possible that alterations in the BMPR1B signal transduction can affect the colonic cells and thus influence the composition and/or activity of gut microbiota.

29439449|t|4.1. Animals and Grouping
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Based on the TaqMan assay using the FecB mutation probe, three FecB genotypes with a total of 59 pluriparous ewes were selected from the nucleus herd of STH sheep in the southwest region of the province of Shandong in China. These ewes were all approximately 3 years old and weighed 70 kg. The same character appearance and health condition were also noted in the experimental animals. The average litter size of first and pluriparous parity in STH ewes were 200% and more than 250%. The experimental population was divided into three groups, which included 20 wild-type individuals named the ++ group, 20 heterozygote mutant individuals named the +B group, and 19 homozygous mutant individuals named the BB group. All the experimental procedures mentioned in the present study were approved by the Science Research Department (in charge of animal welfare issue) of the Institute of Animal Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (IAS-CAAS) (Beijing, China). Ethical approval on animal survival was given by the animal ethics committee of IAS-CAAS (No. IASCAAS-AE-03, 12 December 2016).

29439449|t|4.2. Collecting Data of Ovulation Rate
29439449|a|

29439449|t|During the spring season, all of the experimental ewes underwent estrus synchronization. Without any interference of exogenous hormones, which may induce superovulation in ewes, CIDR (progesterone 300 mg) was inserted into the animals’ vaginas for 12 days, and 5 mL of vitamin AD was intramuscularly injected to protect the vaginal epithelium. Forage and drinking water were provided ad libitum over the duration of the experiment. After one week from the CIDR removal (luteal phase), a laparoscopy procedure was adopted for ovulation rate determination. Ovulation rate was equal to the total number of corpus luteum on both sides of an ewe’s ovary.

29439449|t|4.3. Sample Collection and Follicle Data Measurement
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Estrus synchronization mentioned above was adopted again to collect follicular fluid (FF) and ovarian vein serum (OVS). The specific protocol was as follows: after 45 h from the CIDR removal, all visible ovarian follicles with a diameter of 3.5 mm or greater were selected for follicular diameter determination. FF and OVS collection were achieved through minimally invasive surgery. The diameter of a follicle was the average value of its length (L) and width (W), which was measured by vernier caliper and the estimated volume (V) of FF was calculated using the following formula: V = 4/3 × π × [(L/2 + W/2)/2]3 []. FF samples were aspirated from non-atretic follicles with a 22-gauge needle attached to a 2 mL sterile syringe (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) [,,]. Cell debris were removed from FF by centrifuging at 4 °C at 2000 rpm for 10 min. Full blood was aspirated from ovarian veins using a 25 gauge needle with a 1 mL sterile syringe (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and collected in a BD SST tube. After incubating at 25 °C for 30 min aimed at clotting, OVS samples were collected from full blood and centrifuged at 4 °C at 3500 rpm for 10 min. FF samples and OVS samples were all frozen at liquid nitrogen instantly and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Finally, 11, 11, and 8 biologic repetitions of FF were collected, and 10, 10, and 10 biologic repetitions of OVS were collected, respectively, in the ++, +B, and BB genotype groups for metabolomics analysis.

29439449|t|4.4. LC-MS and GC-MS Analysis
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Metabolite extraction and detection were performed at Metabolon Inc. (Durham, NC, USA) as previously described []. FF and OVS samples (100 μL) were extracted through the automated MicroLab STAR® system (Hamilton Company, Bonaduz, Switzerland), and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS in a positive and negative ion mode (UPLC: Waters, Milford, MA, USA; mass spectrometer: Thermo-Finnigan LTQ, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, scan range, 80–1000 m/z) and by GC-MS (Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer, scan range 50–750 m/z).

29439449|t|4.5. Data Extraction and Compound Identification
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Extraction of raw data, peak identification, and QC were performed using Metabolon’s hardware and software according to previously published methods []. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards based on the retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) on all molecules present in the library. 
29439449|a|

29439449|t|4.6. Metabolite Quantification and Statistical Analysis
29439449|a|

29439449|t|Peaks were quantified based on the area under the curve. The normalized data for each compound were corrected into the medians of data equaling to 1.00 and making other data point proportionate. The normalized data points were also beneficial for data visualization. 
29439449|a|

29439449|t|The chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables such as the ovulation rate and the follicle number difference. One-way ANOVA was adopted to analyze continuous variables of ovulation follicle diameter and the levels of biochemicals. To assess the relationship between metabolic changes and ovulation rates, the Spearman correlation was calculated using scaled imputed log-transformed metabolite levels and ovulation rate values (R, version 3.0.2). Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were used to obtain a high-level view of metabolomic datasets. PCA is a mathematical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principle components. HCA assesses sample similarity by grouping a “hierarchy” of clustered samples and grouping metabolically similar samples close to one another. Random forest was employed to determine key biochemicals and to differentiate classification groups. Statistical analyses mentioned above were performed with the Array Studio, version 7.2 (OmicsSoft Corporation, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) and R version 3.0.2 ().

29439449|t|5. Conclusions
29439449|a|

29439449|t|The results from theses global metabolomics studies comparing ewes carrying FecB mutation (homozygous and heterozygous) in relation to non-carriers differed in a number of metabolic readouts with a more pronounced metabolic impact of the FecB gene in FF than in OVS (higher number of statistically significant changes, better group separation in PCA and HCA). In FF, changes in amino acid metabolism relating to different rates of protein biosynthesis might affect the growth of the developing oocyte. Differences observed in the biochemicals involved in redox homeostasis reflected a higher oxidative pressure of rapidly dividing cells in BB animals, which indicated a greater antioxidant capacity in FF. Additionally, some key metabolites in ovine FF samples were found to significantly correlate with ovulation rate. Collectively, similar to the ovulation rate, the differences in the metabolic profile in FF is also affected by the FecB genotypes.

29967763|t|Why Is a High Temperature Needed by Thermus thermophilus Argonaute During mRNA Silencing: A Theoretical Study
29967763|a|

29967763|t|Thermus thermophiles Argonaute (TtAgo) is a complex, which is consisted of 5′-phosphorylated guide DNA and a series of target DNA with catalytic activities at high temperatures. To understand why high temperatures are needed for the catalytic activities, three molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations at 310, 324, and 338K were performed for the TtAgo-DNA complex to explore the conformational changes between 16-mer guide DNA/15-mer target DNA and TtAgo at different temperatures. The simulation results indicate that a collapse of a small β-strand (residues 507–509) at 310 K caused Glu512 to move away from the catalytic residues Asp546 and Asp478, resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity, which was not observed in the simulations at 324 and 338 K. The nucleic acid binding channel became enlarged at 324 and 338K, thereby facilitating the DNA to slide in. Binding free energy calculations and hydrogen bond occupancy indicated that the interaction between TtAgo and the DNA was more stable at 324K and 338K than at 310 K. The DNA binding pocket residues Lys575 and Asn590 became less solvent accessible at 324 and 338K than at 310 K to influence hydrophilic interaction with DNA. Our simulation studies shed some light on the mechanism of TtAgo and explained why a high temperature was needed by TtAgo during gene editing of CRISPR.

29967763|t|Introduction
29967763|a|

29967763|t|Argonaute (Ago) proteins preform a critical role in guide target RNA recognition, cleavage, and product release, which depend on key components of a RNA-induced silencing complex (Peters and Meister, ; Hutvagner and Simard, ; Kawamata and Tomari, ; Sheng et al., ). These proteins belong to the TNRC6/GW182 protein family, coordinates downstream silencing events, which also named TNRC6A-C and GW proteins in humans. Ago proteins are provided with four domains with distinct functions (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, ; Pfaff and Meister, ; Chen et al., ; Mathys et al., ; Hauptmann et al., ). The N-terminal domain plays a key role for small RNA binding. The P element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI)–Argonaute–Zwille (PAZ) domain is essential for recruiting the middle domain (MID) and the 5′ end of a small RNA. The PIWI domain has the same function as the RNase H domain, and some Ago proteins can serve as small RNA-guided endonucleases (Hauptmann et al., ). The PIWI domain is essential for the cleavage activity of Ago in which the Asp–Asp–Asp/His catalytic triad of Ago processes the identification of double stranded RNAs and the cleaving of their strand (Liu et al., ; Song et al., ; Ma et al., ; Rivas et al., ; Yuan et al., ; Parker and Roe, ). It also acts on guide-target RNA duplexes to cleave their target strand. Mg2+ cation mediates the endonucleolytic cleavage of a target RNA strand (Martinez and Tuschl, ; Schwarz et al., ; Lingel and Sattler, ; Jinek and Doudna, ; Parker, ), thereby forming 3′-OH and 5′-phosphate ends (Elbashir et al., ). A series of experimental structures of Thermus thermophilus Argonaute (TtAgo) binding to various complexes of different nucleic acid strands provide insights into conformational changes in proteins and DNAs (Jung et al., ; Zhu et al., ,; Sheng et al., ). Two structures, namely, PDB ID 3F73 and PDB ID 3HM9, whose substrates have different lengths (Wang et al., ,), suggested that the PAZ domain undergo a series of motions during a catalytic cycle. They also reveal the PAZ domain disassociates from the 3′ end of the guide upon target binding (Xia et al., ; Wang et al., ; Nam et al., ; Swarts et al., ; Jiang et al., ).

29967763|t|This study focused on TtAgo. Figure 1 shows the crystal structure of TtAgo (PDB ID 4NCB) with bound 16-mer guide DNA and 15-mer target DNA (Sheng et al., ). TtAgo is also made up by four functional domains, similar to other Ago proteins, which named N, PAZ, MID and C-terminal PIWI domain. These four domains are connected by two linker domains L1 (Linker 1) and Linker 2 (L2) (Figures 1A–F). MID bind to 5′ terminals of the guide and PAZ bind to 3′ terminals of the guide, both of them define the nucleic acid binding channel (Figure 1C and Figure S1). Driven mainly by positively charged residues of TtAgo and negatively charged DNA backbone atoms (Zander et al., ; Swarts et al., ; Figure S1A), the nucleotides 2–8 of the guide of 5′ segment, which called seed region, involved the combination of the channel binding (Figures S1B,C). The correct positioning of the seed region is important for the binding between the target nucleic acid and TtAgo and human Ago (Lee et al., ; Khin et al., ). The distance between Glu512 and active center (Asp478, Asp546, and Asp660) directly affects the activity of TtAgo. When Glu512 is far from the catalytic pocket (Figure S1D; Wang et al., ,), it turns out to be a cleavage-incompatible conformation. Glu512 positioned on loop L2, close to the catalytic pocket, represents a key residue for a cleavage-compatible conformation (Figure 1G and Figure S1E).

29967763|t|As CRISPR/Cas9 becomes a popular molecular biology technology for gene editing, there is a continuous interest in searching for new genome-editing methods. Recently, it has been reported that argonaute proteins prossess DNA-guided sequence-specific DNA endonuclease activity in Pyrococcus furiosus, Thermus thermophilus, and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Beshnova et al., ; Cherstvy and Teif, ; Harikrishna and Pradeepkumar, ) and it can be as a host defense system to eliminate invading nucleic acids. These argonaute proteins usually needs high temperature to be fully active, which may restrict the application in many aspects. In 2016, the argonaute protein (NgAgo) from Natronobacterium gregoryi was reported to as mesophilic microbe whose enzymes, which is functional at 310K. Compared to Cas9, it have higher genome editing activity in mammalian cells (Chandradoss et al., ). Since NgAgo does not require a PAM motif and the authors reported the PAM motif is not essential for NgAgo and high efficiency to targets of high guanine-cytosine content, NgAgo was once considered promising as a useful tool for genome editing. However, as soon as researchers set off on a whirlwind of experiments (Chandradoss et al., ; Salomon et al., ), questions started to emerge and the hope was quickly faded. Nevertheless, it is unclear why NgAgo cannot perform the function of TtAgo, although the two proteins have significant sequence similarity, and whether it is possible to use or modify argonaute as a target for gene editing.

29967763|t|It has been reported that TtAgo is active at high temperatures, not at low temperatures. But how temperature affects TtAgo activity, it has not been clarified so far. A few molecular dynamics (MD) studies on siRNA–TtAgo and siRNA–hAGO2 complexes have been conducted (Wang et al., ; Nam et al., ; Hanlun et al., ). Jiang et al. constructed from MD simulations and found that MSMs can elucidate the conformational dynamics of AGO at biologically relevant timescales (Hanlun et al., ). Jinhyuk Lee pointed out that they revealed different structural conformations of the RNA duplex in Ago2, depending on Mg2+concentration and demonstrated that cation effects on Ago2 structural flexibility are critical to its catalytic/functional activity, with low Mg2+ favoring greater Ago2 flexibility and less miRNA/mRNA duplex stability, thus favoring slicing (Nam et al., ). Wang et al. discovered three findings during MD simulations: (1) three important (PAZ, Mid and PIWI) domains existed in Argonaute which defined the global dynamics of the protein; (2) the interdomain correlated movements were so crucial for the interaction of Ago-RNAs that they not only facilitated the relaxation of the interactions between residues surrounding the RNA binding channel but also induced certain conformational changes; and (3) it was just these conformational changes that expand the cavity of the active site and open putative pathways for both the substrate uptake and product release (Wang et al., ). However, several fundamental questions remain unanswered: (1) How does the temperature affect the catalytic activity of Ago? (2) What factors cause the conformational changes in the catalytic center at different temperatures?

29967763|t|In the present work, MD simulations and binding free energy calculations (molecular mechanics–Poisson–Boltzmann surface area, MM-PBSA) were performed on 16-mer guide DNA, 15-mer target DNA, and TtAgo at temperatures of 310, 324, and 338K to find possible answers to these questions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also applied to investigate the interactions between TtAgo and DNA. Our MD results provided some informative clues for the mechanism of conformational changes in the catalytic center at different temperatures.

It was very interesting reliable target for MD simulation. And so we chose TtAgo (PDB Id 4NCB) to perform simulations. The initial structure of TtAgo–nucleic acid complex in the MD simulations was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 4NCB at 2.19 A resolution). TtAgo is a 685-amino acid protein, and its binding nucleic acid is composed of 16-mer guide DNA and 15-mer target DNA. The Mg2+ in the 4NCB structure were also used in the simulations.

29967763|t|The three systems with different temperatures (310, 324, and 338K) were utilized in 200 ns MD simulations with NAMD2.10 b1 by using CHARMM27 all-force field parameters (Best et al., ).

In three system, the complexes were placed in the explicit TIP3P water model (Jorgensen et al., ), and extended at 15 Å from water molecules in a cubic periodic box. The systems were added with sodium and chloride ions to obtain a final ion concentration of 0.15 mol/L. To avoid steric clashes or improper geometries, the steepest descent algorithm with 50,000 steps was carried out to was energetically minimized for each system. The Langevin dynamics (Schlick, ) was used to constant temperature control with a damping coefficient (gamma) of 1.0 ps. The long-range electrostatic interactions was calculated by Particle Mesh Ewald summation algorithm (Darden et al., ). Each simulation was performed for 200 ns for the protein–nucleic acid complexes at different temperatures (310, 324, and 338K) by using a pressure coupling time constant of 2.0 ps and a temperature coupling time constant of 0.1 ps and a pressure coupling time constant of 2.0 ps. The timestep for each simulation was 1ps.

29967763|t|Clusteringis a general data-mining technique (Cormack, ; Jain et al., ) using different methods (algorithms) that can be applied to judge structure similarity. In this study, clustering was performed on three systems (the 310K, 324K, and 338K) molecular dynamics simulation trajectories using the RMSD as a metric according to hierarchical method (Rokach and Maimon, ) into distinct groups. The cut off value of RMSD was set with 2.0Å for each systems. Then the TtAgo structure in the 200 ns simulation trajectories which had the similar conformation were divided into the same cluster. The proportion of each cluster were calculated and representative frame of the two largest clusters were extracted for the further analysis.

29967763|t|Stability of TtAgo in different temperature systems
29967763|a|

29967763|t|To analyze the influence of temperature on TtAgo activity, the 200 ns molecular dynamics simulation prepared at three temperatures (310, 324, and 338K) were prepared and the simulation of each temperature was repeated three times. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was monitored with the three different temperature systems of MD trajectories to measure the stability of each domain of TtAgo with temperature variation and to examine the protein stability during the MD simulations. The RMSD of protein backbone atoms and different domain backbone atoms was conducted (Figure 2 and Figure S2). In Figure S2, the RMSD variations of the different temperature systems for three times at the 200 ns time scale indicated that the complexes had the similar atomic coordinates and the initial structures. The RMSDs of the 310, 324, and 338K systems converged to 1.80, 2.40, and 2.20 Å, respectively, indicating that the three systems were stable. The RMSDs of different domains in the three systems are shown in Figures 2A–F. The Linker 1 domain of TtAgo became more flexible in the 324K system (Figure 2B) than that of the 310 and 338 K systems, whereas the PIWI domain was more flexible in the 338K system than in the two other systems (Figure 2F). The increase in temperature causes the protein residues to fluctuate dramatically. In this study, rising the temperature to 324K and 338K resulted in an increase of flexible for Linker 1 or PIWI domains. This may affect the relative position between the Linker 1 and PIWI and thus regulated the catalytic activity of TtAgo. In Figure S3, the total energy vs. time was also calculated and it can be seen that the total energy for three systems keep steady during 200 ns simulation. In addition, We chose the four structures with lower energy from three simulation trajectories and calculated the Ramachandran Plot. As the Figures S4–S6. The four lower energy structures for each system had the same Ramachandran conformation which indicated that the whole simulation process was stable.

29967763|a|

29967763|t|Then the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) for the backbone atoms of the nucleic acids with TtAgo protein in different temperature systems was analyzed to determine the mobility of the complexes. Figure 3 illustrates that the large punctuations of residues mainly occurred in the 324 and 338K systems. The RMSF fluctuations of Gly38, Asp62, and Gly83 located at the N terminus (Figure 3A), Arg123 and Arg137 located at Linker1 (Figure 3B), Pro218 located at PAZ (Figure 3C), Ile297 and Arg324 located at Linker 2 (Figure 3D), Gln387 located at MID (Figure 3E), and Asp478, Glu507, Gly547, and Gly612 located at PIWI (Figure 3F) were higher in the 324 and 338K systems than in the 310 K system. The results indicated that the protein at 324 and 338K exhibited a higher mobility than at 310 K during MD simulations. Asp478, Glu507, and Gly547 near the active center at the PIWI domain that exhibited a high mobility in the 324 and 338K systems might affect the catalytic activity of TtAgo. To further confirm the RMSF results, we calculated the RMSD values for each residue, and then colored each according to the RMSD value (Figures 3G–I). It can be seen that the intensity of the movement of various residues in the 324 or 338K system was higher than that in the 310K system, especially in the Linker 2 and active pocket domain. In order to further analyze residual atomic flexibility, an isotropic temperature factor (B-factor) has been calculated and the results was shown in Figure S7. As we can see, the change trend of B-factor was consistent with that of RMSF and RMSD of individual residues. Figure S8 shows that the radius of gyration (Rg) in different domains in the three systems during the 200 ns time scale MD was stable.

29967763|t|The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) predicts the number of residues present in the outlier regions (surface) of the protein and the number of residues that are in the hydrophobic core (buried). In this study, the time-dependent SASA in the different domains of TtAgo from the simulations was also calculated (Figure S9). The results showed that the ensembles of the different domains in the three temperature systems were similar, which indicated that the change in temperature hardly influenced the SASA value of each domain. This analysis further calculated the SASA values of the residues that interact with the guide DNA and target DNA. As we can see in Figure S10A, the SASA of the hydrophilic residues Lys575 and Asp590 decreased in the 324 and 338K systems compared with that in the 310K system, thereby illustrating increased interaction with the DNA. Asp590 interacted with the G1 of the target DNA (Figure S10B), whereas Lys575 interacted with the C11 and C12 of the target DNA (Figure S10C), forming a tighter interaction with DNA. This result indicated that TtAgo at 324 and 338K might have undergone drifting, thereby leading to its transition into an advantageous conformation and binding with a nucleic acid.

29967763|t|Conformational changes in different temperature systems
29967763|a|

29967763|t|It has been reported that the binary complex of a yeast Ago with a bound 5′-phosphorylated guide RNA strand have found that the distance between Glu512 and catalytic pocket composed of three Asp residues, namely, Asp478, Asp546, and Asp660, determines the activity of Ago (Nakanishi et al., ). The activated Ago needs to insert Glu512 into the catalytic pocket. The change in the distance between Glu512 and the catalytic pocket during MD simulations in the three temperature systems was also analyzed to observe the influence of temperature change on enzyme catalytic activity. In Figure 4A, the distance between Glu512 and Asp478 in the 310K system increased from 10 to 21 Å at 80 ns. The distance between Glu512 and Asp546 in the 310K system also increased from 9.50 to 23 Å at 80 ns (Figure 4B). In the 324 and 338K systems, the distance from Glu512 to Asp546 and Asp478 was approximately 10 Å during MD simulations. In addition, the distance between Glu512 and Asp478 or Asp546 for other two repeated simulations were calculated and the results were prepared in Figure S11. It can be seen that the distance between Glu512 and Asp478 or Asp546 showed a remarkably increase at 47 and 90 ns in 310K system respectively. But for the 324 and 338K systems, the distance from Glu512 to Asp546 and Asp478 was approximately 10 Å during two MD simulations. This finding implied that the distance from the Glu512 to the active center in the 310K system was larger than that in the 324 and 328K systems. To confirm these results, we compared the structures between 0 and 150 ns at different temperatures (Figures 4C–H).The distance from Glu512 OE2 to Asp546 OD1 and Asp478 OD1 at 150 ns was 2.5 times than at 0 ns in the 310K system (Figures 4C,D). The distance between 0 and 150 ns changed slightly in the 324 and 338K systems compared with that in the 310 K system (Figures 4E, 5H). To illustrate the dynamic process of distance change, we created animations 1–3 in Supporting information of the distance between the Glu512 OE2 and Asp478 OD1 of the visual dynamic variation at three different temperatures. The results revealed that Glu512 was far from the catalytic pocket at 310K, and the enzyme activity at 324 and 338K was stronger than that at 310K.

29967763|t|To explain the cause of the change in distance, we investigated the secondary structure modifications during 200 ns MD simulations in the different temperature systems (Figures S12A–C and Figure 5; Table 1). The β-strand of Glu507 to Gln509 near Glu512 disappeared at 150 ns compared with that at1.5 ns in the 310K system (Figure S12A). The β-strand contents of Glu507 to Gln509 in the 310, 324, and 338K systems were 1.50, 37.60, and 46.80%, respectively (Table 1, the β-strand contents of Glu507 to Gln509 in the 310, 324, and 338K systems for other two repeated simulations were calculated and the results were prepared in Tables S1, S2). Secondary structure analysis revealed that the short intermediate β-sheet at 324 and 338K during 200 ns molecular dynamics simulation represented the ordered structure that might help maintain the close distance between Glu512 and the catalytic pocket. Glu512 moved far from the catalytic pocket when β-sheet disappeared.

29967763|a|

29967763|t|The minimum distances from Linker 1 to PIWI and from PAZ to PIWI have been reported to determine the nucleic acid binding channel in TtAgo. In our study, DCH1 was used to describe the center of mass (c.o.m.) distance from the part of L1 (residues 165–174, highlighted in red) to the long helix on PIWI (residues 654–668, highlighted in blue). DCH2 was the c.o.m. distance from the part of PAZ (residues 192–202, highlighted in pink) to the part of PIWI (residues 572–581, highlighted in green), as shown in Figure 6A. These two distances were used to measure the diameter of the nucleic acid binding channel. To analyze the effect of temperature change on the nucleic acid binding channel, we detected the changes in DCH1 and DCH2 during 200ns MD in the different temperature systems (Figures 6B,C). DCH1 varied at 27.5, 28.5, and 29.5 Å in the 310, 324, and 338K systems, respectively. These findings suggested that the minimum distance from Linker 1 to PIWI was larger in the 324 and 338K systems than that in the 310K system. Similarly, DCH2 reached 31 and 30 Å in the 324 and 338K systems and in the 310K system, respectively.

29967763|a|

29967763|t|CHEXVIS is a tool used for molecular channel calculation and visualization based on alpha complex representation (Masood et al., ). In addition to predictive channels, channel residues and their flexibility can be predicted by CHEXVIS. In our study, this tool was utilized to analyze the distinction of the nucleic acid binding channels in the different temperature systems at 150 ns for 200 ns MD (Figures 6D–F; Table 2). The length of the channel in TtAgo in the 310K system (60.1Å) was longer than those in the 324 (50.37Å) and 338K (50.76Å) systems. Studies on bottlenecks have recommended promising areas for the modification of channel properties because their substitutions can affect the informative tunnel geometry when protein dynamics is considered. The results showed that the bottleneck of TtAgo in the 310K system was 3.452 Å and changed to 4.375 and 4.362 Å in the 324 and 338K systems, respectively. The analysis of bulkiness and average flexibility of channel residues, which were presented in a 2D profile, suggested that the flexibility of the channel residues was higher in the 324 and 338K systems than in the 310K system. With such a high flexibility, the channels easily become wide. These results indicated that the diameter of nucleic acid binding channels were larger and the binding of nucleic acid and protein may occur more easily in the 324 and 338K systems than in the 310K system as temperature increased. Our theoretical finding is consistent with the computational study made by Wang et al. ().

Then the representative structures of most populated cluster in cluster1 and cluster2 were selected to analyze the conformation and channel. It can be seen that the residues Glu507 to Gln509 in both the representative structures of cluster1 and cluster2 at 310K formed a loop. The DCH1 and DCH2 in cluster1 representative structures were 27.43 and 29.37Å while they were 27.28 and 29.69Å in cluster2 representative structures, respectively.

The percentage population of cluster1 and cluster2 for 324K and 338K systems were 46.1, 27.3, 53.2, and 21.4%, respectively. The sum of cluster1 and cluster2 both in those two systems were over 70%. Two representative structures based clustering approach at 324K (cluster1 and cluster2) were extracted the results were shown in Figure 7B. In those conformations, the residues Glu507 to Gln509 remained β-sheet and the DCH1 were over 29.56Å in two representative structures while the and DCH2 were over 30 Å. As the same as 324K systems, residues Glu507 to Gln509 in cluster1 and cluster2 of 338K systems for representative structures also presented β-sheet. The DCH1 and DCH2 at 338K were more than 29 Å (Figure 7C). These findings revealed that the β-sheet (Glu507 to Gln509) at 310K formed a loop but remained in its original state in the 324 and 338K systems. These results were consistent with those illustrated in Figure 6. The different nucleic acid binding channels in the three temperature systems in the cluster1 and cluster2 of TtAgo illustrated that DCH1 and DCH2 in the 310K system were lower than those in the 324 and 338K systems.

29967763|t|The hydrogen bond occupancy between nucleic acids (target DNA and guide DNA) and TtAgo during the 200 ns MD is listed in Tables S3, S4 to obtain insights into the molecular interactions between TtAgo and nucleic acid at different temperatures. The MD simulation results showed that the number of hydrogen bonds between nucleic acids and TtAgo in the 310K system was more than that in the 324 and 338K systems. For example, the hydrogen bonds, R59 (HN2)—DC5 (O2), D590 (OD1)—DG19 (N1) that connected the protein and the target DNA, and R615 (NE)—DT6 (O5′) and Y457 (NZ)—DA3 (O2P) that linked TtAgo and guide DNA disappeared in the 324 and 338K systems. The decrease in hydrogen bond occupancy was due to the increase in the distance between hydrogen bond donors and receptors. The distances of the donors and receptors were examined during 200 ns MD (Figure 8). In Figure 8, the distances from the donors to the receptors were larger in the 324 and 338K systems than in the 310K system. The rise in temperature increased the entropy, thereby promoting the relative motion of proteins and DNA. Such an increase reduced the stability of hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic reduction greatly increased the solubility of TtAgo and nucleic acids in solvents, resulting in TtAgo was easier to complete the cutting action of nucleic acid. Overall, the binding of nucleic acid and TtAgo became tighter at higher temperature and TtAgo has high activity at high temperature.

29967763|t|MM-PBSA calculations
29967763|a|

29967763|t|It was well known that the arguably most popular end point method to calculate the free energy of binding between the enzyme and the ligands is the topic of MM/PBSA molecular mechanics [MM] with–Boltzmann [PB] and surface area solvation (Guimarães, ). The method has been used in a range of settings, including protein design by free energy calculations. The accuracy is better than for docking and scoring methods (Rifai et al., ), comparable to other end point methods, such as LIE methods. Furthermore, it is very fast and thence it was chosen to used for calculated the free energy of binding. The binding free energy of the TtAgo–nucleic acid complex was evaluated using MM–GBSA to confirm the results. The non-bonded van der Waals (ΔEvdW), non-bonded electrostatic (ΔEelec) interactions, and binding free energy (ΔGbin) of the TtAgo–nucleic complex in the three temperature systems are shown in Table 3. The binding free energies were driven primarily by electrostatic interactions and polar solvation, whereas the vdW interaction, polar solvation, and entropy basically remained the same. No significance was found in the variations in the binding affinity between nucleic acid and TtAgo in the different temperature systems. Table 3 shows that the binding free energy of the TtAgo–nucleic complex at 310K (−419.3667 kcal/mol) was higher than those at 324K (−461.1173 kcal/mol) and 338K (−434.8954 kcal/mol). (Seen from Tables S5, S6, it listed the other two repeated simulations results for MM-GBSA Calculations. The results were similar to the results listed in Table 3). These data indicated that the interaction between TtAgo and nucleic acid was more stable at 324 and 338K than at 310K.

29967763|t|To analyze the effects of individual amino acids on TtAgo and DNA binding, the per-residue free energy decomposition was performed to characterize and identify the crucial residues that mainly contributed to the binding free energy (Figure 9). Six amino acid residues, namely, Tyr171, Arg172, Ile173, Arg174, Thr174, and Met413 had relatively low energies in the three temperature systems compared with other residues and might play a pivotal role in combining with guide DNA (Figure 9A). It can be seen that Asp546, Lys575, and Asp590 had lower energy which instructed the important role in the process of the combination of target DNA.

29967763|a|

29967763|t|TtAgo is active at high temperatures. The mechanism by which the temperature affects the activity of TtAgo remains poorly understood. In the present study, MD simulations revealed that the disappearance of β-sheet from Glu507 to Gln509 at 310K could cause Glu512 to move far from the catalytic pocket, thereby reducing the activity of TtAgo. The binding channel of the nucleic acid widened at 324 and 338K. Consequently, the binding of nucleic acids and proteins occurred more easily at 324 and 338 K than at 310 K. Binding free energy (MM-PBSA) calculations and hydrogen bond occupancy showed that the binding between TtAgo and nucleic acid was more stable at 324and 338K than at 310 K. These results suggested that the temperature influenced the activity of TtAgo by regulating the binding channel width of TtAgo and the distance from Glu512 to the active center. The activity of TtAgo was higher at 324 and 338K than that at 310K. Our results would be useful as a basis for further studies on the influence of temperature on TtAgo and design of CRISPR methods.

30065756|t|Reports about presence and toxicity of Cd2+ in different chemical industrial effluents prompted the researchers to explore some economical, rapid, sensitive, and accurate methods for its determination and removal from aqueous systems. In continuation of series of investigations, adsorption of Cd2+ onto the stem of Saccharum arundinaceum is proposed in the present work. Optimization of parameters affecting sorption potential of Cd2+ including pH, contact time, temperature, sorbent dose, and concentration of sorbate was carried out to determine best suited conditions for maximum removal of sorbate. To understand the nature of sorption process, linear and nonlinear forms of five sorption isotherms including Freundlich and Langmuir models were employed. Feasibility and viability of sorption process were evaluated by calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of the process, while error analysis suggested best fitted sorption model on sorption data. Thermodynamic studies demonstrated exothermic nature of reaction, while kinetic studies suggested pseudo-second order of reaction.

30065756|t|1. Introduction
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Environmental pollution should be taken into special consideration because it is a very serious matter affecting every type of organism at every level. The most adversely affected environmental resource is water []. As water is an essential element for the survival of living beings, it is very necessary to keep it pure and clean []. Quality of drinking water is of prime importance for mankind because waterborne diseases can decimate population of the whole area. These diseases arise due to toxic release of chemicals from industrial zones []. Particularly in industrial areas, these waterborne diseases are a great threat towards safety of water supplies. Other sources which may pollute water include domestic waste, pesticides run off from agricultural land, metal plating operations, and so on. Key contaminants present in water include heavy metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons, pathogens, detergents, pesticides, algal nutrients, trace organic compounds, dyes, and so on. These hazardous substances are of concern because of their ultimate effect on survival of human life []. Heavy metals like Cd, Zn, Ni, and Pb are present in relatively major amounts in industrial effluents and enter in rivers and oceans and ultimately pollute groundwater leading to adverse effects on aquatic life. Metals resist the process of biodegradability and hence remain in ecosystem, affecting food chain and human health []. In order to provide clean environment and healthy lifestyle to our coming generations, it is necessary to remove hazardous pollutants from the environment. In environmental restoration areas, conventional techniques are practiced to eradicate those pollutants from the environment which include chemical precipitation, evaporative method, electrolytic extraction, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and electrochemical and membrane processes []. All these methods are costly and produce large amount of sludge which is difficult to dispose of. Use of biological materials for the removal of pollutants from aqueous media is considered superior to other methods in terms of cost effectiveness and simple design. It is a surface phenomenon, in which pollutants get accumulated on the surface of the adsorbent material. Binding nature is based on type of sorbent and sorbate, but mostly physisorption or chemisorption takes place []. Materials with ease in availability and low cost are preferred for the purpose. In this context, agrowastes are considered a significant material for adsorption. Binding capacity of these materials can be intensified by physical and chemical treatments and heat therapy [].

30065756|t|To explore the appropriate adsorbent, it is necessary to establish equilibrium correlation of sorbent to predict behavior of sorbent under different experimental conditions. This equilibrium correlation is developed by using equilibrium isotherms. These isotherms express way of sorbent interaction with the surface of adsorbent, that is, whether it is monolayer or multilayer sorption []. Similarly, thermodynamic studies are of prime importance to predict whether the adsorption is spontaneous or not. Furthermore, it provides information about suitable temperature range for sorption and nature of sorbent and sorbate at equilibrium [].

30065756|t|On the basis of literature survey and indigenous availability of agrowaste materials, the stem of Saccharum arundinaceum (hardy sugar cane) was collected from different regions of Sargodha District, Pakistan. After collection, the sample was properly washed with deionized water to remove dust and surface impurities. The sorbent was initially dried in an open container at room temperature and later in an electric oven (Model, LEB-1-20) at 105°C for 24 h to remove all the moisture contents. The dried sorbent was ground, and appropriate particle size was separated by sieves and was stored for further analyses.

For chemical treatment, the sorbent (20 g) was stirred for 4 h in 1 L solution of 0.1 M NaOH or HCl followed by filtration and extensive washing with distilled water to remove any traces of acid/base. After that, the treated sorbent material was dried at 110°C and stored in airtight zipper bags at −4°C before further use.

30065756|t|2.4. Characterization of Sorbent
30065756|a|

30065756|t|To determine different physical and chemical parameters affecting adsorption, it is necessary to characterize the sorbent. Therefore, physical and chemical characterization was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

30065756|a|

30065756|t|In order to study adsorption pathway and equilibrium relationship between sorbent and sorbate, it is necessary to design proper adsorption isotherms. Isotherms predict the appropriate parameters and behavior of sorbent towards different sorption systems []. In this context, linear and nonlinear models are utilized using Microsoft Excel®2007 (equilibrium isotherms applied on the present work are given in Table 1s of supplementary data).

30065756|t|2.6. Error Functions
30065756|a|

30065756|t|In order to determine best fitting of linear or nonlinear models onto adsorption data, it is necessary to calculate the error function []. These error functions include sum square error, hybrid functional error, average relative error, sum of absolute error, nonlinear chi-square, and so on (calculated error functions and their equations are present in Table 2s of supplementary data).
30065756|a|

30065756|t|2.7. Thermodynamic Investigations
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Thermodynamic investigations are another important parameter of adsorption studies. For thermodynamic studies, the adsorption experiment was carried out at different temperature conditions and calculated parameters included enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG).
30065756|a|

30065756|t|For this purpose, (1)–(3) were applied  where R is the natural gas constant and K C is the constant at equilibrium and is calculated aswhere C e is the concentration of sorbent at equilibrium condition.
30065756|a|

30065756|t|2.8. Adsorption Kinetics
30065756|a|

30065756|t|In batch adsorption process, kinetic studies provide information about optimum conditions, mechanism of sorption, and possible rate controlling step. For this purpose, linear and nonlinear form of pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetics is applied on adsorption data []. In order to check the effect of contact time (10–70 min) on adsorption, initial concentration of 100 mg/L for cadmium was prepared and 100 ml of this sample was used for study. Sorbent (0.5 g) was added in this cadmium solution and applied for shaking at 150 rpm speed. After fixed interval of time, the sample was removed from flask and analyzed for cadmium concentration by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The amount of cadmium adsorbed at different time intervals was calculated by employing the following formula:where Q t is the amount of cadmium adsorbed at any time t, Q o and Q e are initial and equilibrium concentrations, respectively. The volume of cadmium solution taken is represented by V(L), and W sorbent is the amount of sorbent in g.

30065756|a|

30065756|t|3.1. Effect of Pretreatment
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Pretreatment has promising effect on adsorption potential of Saccharum arundinaceum. Results reveal that base-treated (97.5%) sorbent shows good efficiency for cadmium sorption as compared to raw (91.15%) and acid-treated (57.6) sorbent as shown in Figure 1. Adsorption capacity depends upon functional groups present on the surface of sorbent and its microporous structure []. Increase in sorption capacity by base treatment can be attributed to hydroxyl groups created on the surface of adsorbent by base treatment or modification of cell wall components by base []. Decrease in adsorption after acid treatments was found as the binding sites available on the surface of biosorbent got destructed due to acid []. So, base-treated Saccharum arundinaceum was used for adsorption analysis.

30065756|t|3.2. Characterization of Sorbents
30065756|a|

30065756|t| Saccharum arundinaceum was characterized in terms of surface morphology and functional group analysis by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
30065756|a|

30065756|t|3.2.1. Scanning Electron Microscopy
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Three native and two treated sorbents (acid- and base-treated Saccharum arundinaceum) were analyzed through scanning electron microscope to study surface morphology. Large pore size available on the surfaces of native and base-treated sorbent was responsible for enhanced adsorption on the surface of these agrowaste materials. Results for SEM analysis are given in Figure 2. Hollow cavities appear in the structure of raw adsorbent, which were responsible for binding of sorbate onto the surface of sorbent. Acid treatment decreases these cavities by deforming surface of the sorbent, so adsorption decreases after acid treatment because surface becomes smooth and thin adsorption layer is formed on the sorbent surface. Raw and base-treated sorbent surface is found rough and cylindrical, which make possible multilayer and thick adsorption on the sorbent surface as compared to smooth surface. Results obtained in the SEM micrograph are in good agreement with reported data [].

30065756|t|3.2.2. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Fourier transform infrared spectrometer provides information about functional groups present on the surface of sorbent and makes possible attachment of sorbate []. FTIR spectra of sorbent obtained in the range of 4000–450 cm−1 wavenumber and major functional groups present in adsorbent are listed in Table 1. A broadband appears in the range of 3000–3700 cm−1 which was due to –OH stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional groups including hydrogen bonding because broadband of –OH group in this range is indication of hydrogen bonding present in the compound. This peak appears in raw and base-treated sorbent but disappears in case of acid treated due to reaction of –OH group with acid hydrogen. Stretching band of –CH appears in 2900–3000 cm−1 wavenumber range for all sorbents. The peak at 1750 cm−1 appears due to C=O and 1200 cm−1 due to C-O functional group. In some cases, –CN also appears at 1049 cm−1 value. Vibration due to secondary amide appears at 1645 cm−1 []. For adsorption purpose, significant role is played by –OH group and heteroatoms to attach sorbate on the surface.

30065756|a|

30065756|t|Adsorption study was performed by the batch adsorption method by varying different parameters including pH, contact time, and initial concentration of sorbate to find best suited conditions for the removal of cadmium from aqueous media.

30065756|t|3.3.1. Effect of Contact Time
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Contact time was varied from 10 to 100 minutes under neutral conditions with constant amount of sorbent (1 g), initial concentration (60 ppm), and shaking speed (150 rpm), and results obtained are shown in Figure 1s (Supplementary material).
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Maximum adsorption was achieved at 60 minutes time interval and no significant increase found by further increase in time. Initially, excess of vacant places are available on the surface of sorbent, and uptake of metal ions was more, so there was continuous increase in adsorption capacity by increasing time slot from zero to 60 minutes. But, further increase could not cause sufficient change in adsorption of metals as vacant spaces are already filled, and equilibrium is achieved [].
30065756|a|

30065756|t|3.3.2. Effect of pH
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Initial pH of the adsorption system has significant role in adsorption of sorbate, as it affects the surface morphology of the sorbent and binding nature of sorbate. The range of pH selected was 2–10 with 1 g sorbent and 60 ppm initial concentration of sorbate. The result given in Figure 2s (Supplementary material) reveals the fact that adsorption capacity is quite low under acidic conditions. When pH is increased, it causes increase in adsorbed amount of sorbate on the surface of sorbent. At low pH value, metals have to compete with H+ ions for adsorption on sorbent surface since H+ ions are present in excess at that pH value. But when pH value is raised, it causes significant increase in adsorption due to attraction developed between negatively charged surfaces of sorbent by –OH groups and positively charged metal ions []. So, for cadmium, optimum pH range was found from 6 to 8; in this range, cadmium shows best adsorption behavior. When pH is further increased, there is decline in adsorption capacity due to formation of metal hydrides.

30065756|t|3.3.3. Effect of Initial Concentration
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Initial concentration of sorbate is another important parameter, which affects the adsorption phenomenon. For this purpose, initial concentration of cadmium was varied in range of 10–100 ppm by keeping all other parameters constant (Figure 3s Supplementary material).

30065756|t|Rapid increase in adsorption capacity was observed initially for adsorption of cadmium on Saccharum arundinaceum as vacant spaces were available on the surface of sorbent. So, rise in concentration also raised adsorption of sorbate on available sites []. Adsorbent readily occupies these adsorption sites, and adsorption capacity has positive influence of concentration in this range. Further increase in concentration from 60 to 100 ppm has no significant effect on adsorption phenomenon. Surface of adsorbent becomes saturated with sorbate, and after establishment of equilibria, increase in concentration has no significant influence on adsorption phenomenon. Previous studies also report that accommodation for sorbate decreases as concentration is very high due to unavailability of resident sites [].

30065756|t|The effect of temperature on adsorption was studied by using temperature range 20, 30, 40, and 50°C with pH 6 (Figure 4s) (Supplementary material). Adsorption of cadmium onto Saccharum arundinaceum agrowaste was found to increase with increase in temperature. At high temperature, intraparticle diffusion increases and more adsorption sites are created which boost up adsorption phenomenon [].

30065756|t|Adsorption system can be designed by adsorption isotherms commonly known as equilibrium isotherms which represent the amount of solute adsorbed per unit weight of sorbent []. These isotherms use equilibrium concentration of sorbent at constant temperature. In order to remove effluents from the system, particular design is optimized to generate proper correlation for experimental data which is called adsorption isotherm. Researches proposed many isotherms in this regard which are based on the adsorption system including Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson, Temkin, and Elovich [, ]. Sorption was carried out by employing linear as well as nonlinear adsorption models by varying initial concentration from 10 to 100 ppm.

30065756|t|3.4.1. Freundlich Isotherm
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Freundlich adsorption isotherm was developed for the heterogeneous system, and it gives concept of multilayer adsorption on the surface of sorbent (Figure 5s Supplementary material).
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Parameters calculated for Freundlich isotherm by employing its linear and nonlinear form are given in Table 4. Freundlich isotherm was obtained by plotting log Cad versus log Ce. K F and n are constants obtained from intercept and slope, respectively. Freundlich adsorption capacity (K F) is an indicator of a system, whether it is favorable for adsorption or not. Adsorption is considered promising if value of K F is found in range of 1–20, and results reveal that in the present study, K F was 9.5 and 12.2, respectively, for linear and nonlinear approaches of Freundlich adsorption isotherm. Similarly, adsorption intensity represented by n indicates fitness of model for adsorption purposes if value of n is above 1. Value of R 2 obtained from the plot is significant (0.9446) representing good fitness of this model for adsorption of cadmium onto Saccharum arundinaceum.

30065756|t|3.4.2. Langmuir Isotherm
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Langmuir adsorption isotherm is based on monolayer adsorption of metal ions on the surface of agrowastes, and energy of adsorption system is considered constant. In order to calculate Langmuir model, initial concentrations were changed from 10 to 100 ppm with 1 g sorbent amount and 1 h shaking time. Distribution of metal ions between liquid and solid surface was calculated by equations given in Table 1, employing linear and nonlinear forms of the model. Langmuir adsorption isotherm was obtained by plotting Ce/Cad versus Ce as shown in Figure 6s Supplementary material. R 2 value obtained for plot was found satisfactory showing fitness of model on the adsorption experiment. Q o represents metal ion uptake per unit mass of adsorbent (mg/g) and b is Langmuir constant []. A dimensionless constant R L is calculated by using Langmuir constant, and initial concentration represents model fitness for a particular system. If value of R L falls between 0 and 1, the system is considered appropriate for adsorption purpose and Table 2 shows results which are in this range. Furthermore, experimental data and predicted results obtained for the present work were found in close correlation with low value of residual sum of square (0.006) making this model applicable for the present work.

30065756|t|3.4.3. Dubinin–Radushkevich Isotherm
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm was designed as an empirical model for adsorption of vapors onto solid surface. It is successfully applied for adsorption of heterogeneous system including solid and liquid. This model is considered more general than Langmuir because in its derivation homogenous surface and constant sorption potential are not assumed []. The relationship given in Table 1s (supplementary data) was employed to relate ln Cad with ε 2, where ε 2 is Polanyi potential which is based on temperature, natural gas constant, and equilibrium concentration as given in the following equation: 
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Slope of the plot gives value of k ad and the intercept is q s. The model showed good applicability on the adsorption system in nonlinear form with high value of R 2.
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm has found very promising applications for determination of nature of sorption, whether it is physical or chemical. For this purpose, k ad obtained from the slope of the plot is used in the following equation: 
30065756|a|

30065756|t|The value of E calculated for the present research was 0.764 and suggests physical nature of sorption. Because the value of E below 8 kj/mol reflects physical sorption and 8–16 kj/mol reflects chemical sorption (Figure 7s Supplementary material).
30065756|a|

30065756|t|3.4.4. Temkin Isotherm
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Temkin adsorption isotherm discusses interaction of sorbent and sorbate, and the model is based on assumption that heat of adsorption will not remain constant. It decreases due to interaction between sorbent and sorbate during adsorption phenomenon []. Linear and nonlinear forms of Temkin model are given in Table 1s (Supplementary data). Equilibrium constant of binding K T provides information about binding energy, and β expresses heat of adsorption for a particular adsorption experiment (Figure 8s Supplementary material). Linear form of Temkin model is found more suitable with high value of binding constant as given in Table 2. The model indicates the exothermic nature of adsorption reaction as B > 0 which is an indicator of heat release during the process [].

30065756|t|3.4.5. Elovich Isotherm
30065756|a|

30065756|t|According to Elovich model, mechanism of adsorption is based on chemical reactions which are responsible for adsorption. Plot of ln C ad/C e versus C ad gives R 2 value close to unity. K E and Q m are obtained from intercept and slope of plot, respectively. K E shows initial sorption rate and Q m is adsorption constant. Initial sorption rate obtained from linear form of Elovich model is quite high (35,100.411) as compared to nonlinear form (11.7891), so making linear form adequate to describe adsorption of cadmium onto Saccharum arundinaceum. Furthermore, R 2 value (0.9033) for linear form is also high than nonlinear form (0.835) (Figure 9s-Supplementary material).

30065756|t|3.5. Error Analysis for Equilibrium Isotherms
30065756|a|

30065756|t|In order to check the fit of adsorption model to experimental data, error functions are used []. In the present work, six error functions were applied on linear and nonlinear form of data by minimizing the error function in a range of concentration used for analysis by employing solver add-in with Microsoft Excel 2010. Results for optimization of equilibrium isotherms by error analysis are given in Table 3. For meaningful results, a comparison of each error function for linear and nonlinear forms was made (Figure 10s Supplementary material).

These isotherms give low values for most of error functions. Applicability of these models for removal of cadmium ions from aqueous media is also studied by many researchers [, ].

Nonlinear form of Temkin isotherm was not found suitable for adsorption of cadmium onto Saccharum arundinaceum agrowaste because of high value of error functions. Freundlich and Elovich isotherms have been proved to be suitable models for this study with low value for error functions.

30065756|t|3.6. Thermodynamic Studies
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Effect of temperature on adsorption was studied by using temperature range 20, 30, 40, and 50°C with pH 6 and variable initial concentration (30–120 ppm). Adsorption of cadmium onto Saccharum arundinaceum agrowaste was found to increase with increase in temperature. At high temperature, intraparticle diffusion increases and more adsorption sites are created which boost up adsorption phenomenon. Results for thermodynamic study are given in Table 4: 
30065756|a|
30065756	169	176	cadmium	Chemical	MESH:D002104

30065756|t|Plot of log Cad/Ce versus 1/T was obtained with R-squared value 0.927. Slop and intercept provide value of ∆H° and ∆S°, respectively, as shown in (10).
30065756|a|

30065756|t|∆G° was calculated by employing (1) given in Section 2 in temperature range 292–328 K. Results show a negative value for Gibb's free energy at all temperature ranges, and ∆G° increases with the increase in temperature. These negative values represent spontaneous nature as well as feasibility of adsorption reaction []. Decrease in ∆G° with the increase in temperature reflects better sorption at elevated temperature. The positive value for change in enthalpy is due to endothermic nature of adsorption of cadmium. Enthalpy was also found positive because randomness in system increases due to solid-liquid interaction during adsorption phenomenon. Sorption energy calculated by Dubinin–Radushkevich model was found below 1 which is an indication of physical nature of cadmium sorption on the surface of sorbent. E < 8 kJ/mol is representative of physical sorption, and E > 8–16 kJ/mol is due to chemical sorption []. For adsorption of cadmium value of E is found below 8, so adsorption of cadmium occurred on the surface and no chemical bonding took place between sorbent and sorbate. Similar results for adsorption of cadmium onto agrowaste were reported in the literature [].

30065756|t|3.7. Adsorption Kinetics
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Adsorption kinetics has prime importance in describing solute uptake rate and time required for adsorption process. In the present work, kinetic study was performed at different time intervals for cadmium adsorption by employing linear and nonlinear forms of pseudo-first- and second-order kinetics. Results indicate that amount of cadmium adsorbed increases with the increase in time interval; however, this increase was sharp in the start of reaction and gradually magnitude of adsorption decreases down. Initially, plenty of active sites were available on the surface of sorbent, so sharp rise in adsorption occurred, but these sites got occupied with the passage of time, so magnitude of adsorption gradually decreases [].

30065756|a|

30065756|t|Poor correlation was obtained for linear form of the model with low value of R 2 (0.0918).

Nonlinear form of pseudo-first-order kinetics was obtained by using Microsoft Excel 2010 [].

30065756|a|

30065756|t|Second-order kinetics is applicable on small amount of initial concentration for determination of initial sorption rate. Different linear and nonlinear forms of pseudo-second-order kinetics are given in Table 3s (Supplementary material). These four linear forms of pseudo-second-order kinetic models were applied on experimental data, and Figures 11s–15s (Supplementary material) show results for these models. Coefficient of determination (R 2), found for type 1, was quite high indicating the best fitting of this model on adsorption data of cadmium. Results obtained for pseudo-second-order kinetic are given in Table 4s (Supplementary material). Theoretical results obtained for amount of cadmium adsorbed at equilibrium are found best fitted with experimental data for pseudo-second-order kinetics. For nonlinear form of pseudo-second-order, a computer-based procedure was used in Microsoft Excel 2010 using solver add-in method as reported in the literature []. For sorption of cadmium onto Saccharum arundinaceum pseudo-second-order kinetic may describe the method of adsorption in quite appropriate way as compared to pseudo-first-order approach. Furthermore, nonlinear form of pseudo-second-order gives close results to experimental data.

30065756|t|3.8. Effect of Interfering Ions
30065756|a|

30065756|t|Process of adsorption becomes complicated in case of multicomponent adsorption as many interactions of sorbent and sorbate are involved. Effect of interfering ions was measured by observing adsorption of one metal ion, and then, by addition of interfering ion change in adsorption capacity was noted. Interfering effect was calculated by employing the following equation:where C mix is the % adsorption of mixture of two metal ions and C is the % adsorption of pure metal on selected sorbent. If the value of C mix/C is found equal to 1, then there is no effect of interfering ions on adsorption phenomenon. However, if it is found less than 1, then adsorption capacity is found to be affected by addition of these interfering ions. To study interference, ions were divided into three categories as monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent ions based on valences of ions. One ion was selected from each class of ions to check the interfering effect on adsorption of cadmium ions. Metals are attached on the surface of sorbent through electrostatic forces, and competition of metals for sorbent place is mainly based on metal ion charge and its attraction towards functional groups present on the surface on adsorbent. Results for interference of metal ions are summarized in Table 5. Metals with high charge value were found to have maximum effect on adsorption of cadmium as compared with those with low charge. Anions have also found to affect the adsorption phenomenon of metal ions but their interference is comparatively very less than cations. Adsorption of anions on sorbent is dependent on charge present on the surface of sorbent. Since negatively charged hydroxyl groups are present on the surface of adsorbent, adsorption of anions is not as favored as cations [].

30065756|a|

30065756|t|Removal of cadmium was performed by employing the stem powder of Saccharum arundinaceum. In order to generate proper correlation for the removal of cadmium, five adsorption isotherms were applied on experimental data including Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin–Radushkevich, Elovich, and Temkin. Error analysis provides information about fitness of these models on experimental data. The model with minimum error was selected best for adsorption data. Order of equilibrium isotherms according to increasing RSS value was found as Temkin > Dubinin–Radushkevich > Elovich > Freundlich > Langmuir.
